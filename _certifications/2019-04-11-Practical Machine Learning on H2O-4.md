**Credential ID: DEZCUC5CTLMR**

In this course, I learned all the core techniques needed to make effective use of H<sub>2</sub>O using H<sub>2</sub>O high-level library. The course covers the materials related to:
- **H<sub>2</sub>O and Fundamentals**: Knowing the H<sub>2</sub>O documentations and understanding the difference between regression, binomial, multinomial, and unsupervised models.
- **Trees And Overfitting**: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and the concept of overfitting.
- **Linear Models**: linear models and grid training.
- **Deep Learning**: early stopping, deep learning classifier, deep learning regressor.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: autoencoder
- **Others**: ensemble models, driveless AI.
