**Credential ID: RTJG6TEYE3MA**

This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science. In the first course on **Linear Algebra** we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.

The second course, **Multivariate Calculus**, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.

The third course, **Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis**, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data.

This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require basic Python and numpy knowledge. At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.
