**Credential ID: JSQ5XCGGXBRJ**

AI is not only for engineers. This is the course to tell everyone--especially your non-technical colleagues--to take.
In this course, I have learned:

- The meaning behind common AI terminology, including neural networks, machine learning, deep learning, and data science
- What AI realistically can--and cannot--do
- How to spot opportunities to apply AI to problems in your own organization
- What it feels like to build machine learning and data science projects
- How to work with an AI team and build an AI strategy in your company
- How to navigate ethical and societal discussions surrounding AI

Though this course is largely non-technical, engineers can also take this course to learn the business aspects of AI.
