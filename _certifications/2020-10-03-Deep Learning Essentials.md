The course developed by IVADO, Mila and Université de Montréal offers diversified learning tools for you to fully grasp the extent of this ground-breaking cross-cutting technology, a critical need in the field. 

Deep Learning is an extension of Machine Learning where machines can learn by experience without human intervention. It is largely influenced by the human brain in the fact that algorithms, or artificial neural networks, are able to learn from massive amounts of data and acquire skills that a human brain would. Thus, Deep learning is now able to tackle a large variety of tasks that were considered out of reach a few years ago in computer vision, signal processing, natural language processing, robotics, and sequential decision-making. Because of these recent advances, various industries are now deploying deep learning models that impact various economic sectors such as transport, health, finance, energy, as well as our daily life in general.

The course covers:
- Machine Learning (ML) and Experimental Protocol
- Introduction to Deep Learning
- Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks
- Bias and Discrimination in ML
