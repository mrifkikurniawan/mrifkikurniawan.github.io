The power of AI is now in the hands of makers, self-taught developers, and embedded technology enthusiasts everywhere with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit. This easy-to-use, powerful computer lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. In this course, I have used Jupyter iPython notebooks on Jetson Nano to build a deep learning classification project with computer vision models.

I have learnt how to:
- Set up your Jetson Nano and camera
- Collect image data for classification models
- Annotate image data for regression models
- Train a neural network on my own data to create my own models
- Run inference on the Jetson Nano with the models I create
