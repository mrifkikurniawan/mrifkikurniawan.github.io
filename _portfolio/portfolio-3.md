This projects was from my bachelor thesis that is about apply hybrid method of Artificial Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic that weighted and optimized by Differential Evolution algorithm for calculating best weight for the hybrid models. This method was applied in maritime weather forecast of rain intensity, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction.
