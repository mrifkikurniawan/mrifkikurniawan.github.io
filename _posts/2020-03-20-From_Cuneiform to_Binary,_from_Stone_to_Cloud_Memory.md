> Just imagine we lived in the 7000 years ago when no letters of alphabet A, B, C to Z were found, or we could not count the number of our fish caught because there were no known names such as numbers 1,2,3 or 9. Then how do we convey event A or information B and then, furthermore, store it so that it becomes our track record in the future?

In the beginning, humans only relied on the most important organ of themselves as storage memory, the brain. Though the brain has 3 fundamental flaws according to Yuval Noah Harari. **First, the brain has limited capacities**. Up to now, researchers are still unable to determine how much memory capacity our brains have. According to Paul Reber, professor of psychology at Northwestern University, which was reported by [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-memory-capacity/), the human brain consists of about one billion neurons, each of which is connected with 1000 other neurons; thus, forming about 3 trillion connections. If quantified in data size, it can be estimated that around 2.5 petabits (million gigabits), which means that capacity can be used to record millions of hours of video. However, it was all just an estimate; the researchers still could not determine the actual size because we do not know how to measure actual memory. Meanwhile, certain experiences require more detail so that they require more space in the brain so that other experiences are forgotten and free up to certain spaces in the brain.

**Secondly, the information stored in the brain will be destroyed when someone who owns the brain dies**. If Einstein lived 7000 years ago and assumed that he had found the postulate of the workings of the universe through the theory of general and special relativity. It is almost certain that the theory will not be known by humans of modern civilization. It might be possible to find it, but it will take several hundred years to uncover it with a large investment of research. We must find traces of historical information and data without writing, drawing, painting because writing as a manifestation of ideas that were not discovered yet at that time. Einstein’s ideas will die when Einstein also dies.

**And third, the human brain is adapted to store and process certain types of information**. By learning, fruit traders can differentiate between rotten and fresh fruits by just seeing or feeling a few parts. Or a snake charmer who becomes a master handler by studying snake behavior, when he can be subdued and not.

## The Emergence of Clay and Stone Letters and Storage Technology
The writings were first discovered by the Sumerian people who lived in the southern region of Mesopotamia around 3400–3000 BC. By scientists, Sumer is considered the first urban civilization in the world, Ancient Mesopotamia as a place where civilization emerged. This article was later called [cuneiform](https://www.ancient.eu/cuneiform/). The geniuses there for the first time used this letter to count and record. In his book “Sapiens”, Yuval Noah Harari explained that Sumerian’s first manuscripts only contained documents about the economy, tax payment records, debt accumulation, and property ownership.

The Sumerian writing system stores information with two marks printed on clay plates. However, with this breakthrough, the Sumerians were able to store far more data than any human brain. Nobody expected this article to make an important momentum of change in the civilization of all time. Until then developed and produced writing that was created in the Mesopotamian era like [The Epic of Gilgamesh](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Epic-of-Gilgamesh), [Atrahasis](https://www.ancient.eu/article/227/the-atrahasis-epic-the-great-flood--the-meaning-of/), [The Descent of Inanna](https://www.ancient.eu/article/215/inannas-descent-a-sumerian-tale-of-injustice/), [The Myth of Etana](https://www.ancient.eu/article/224/the-myth-of-etana/), and [The Enuma Elishiyang](https://www.ancient.eu/article/225/enuma-elish---the-babylonian-epic-of-creation---fu/) written in cuneiform. It takes several centuries of research to be understood by modern humans.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
  
Until the middle of the 19th century, George Smith (1840–1876) and Henry Rawlinson (1810–1895) translated The Epic of Gilgamesh into English. Which then becomes [momentum](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/magazine/2018/01-02/history-gilgamesh-epic-discovery/) the opening of Mesopotamian historical data. This is the beginning of the writing which is then followed by variations of writing and language that we know today. Writing makes a man able to manifest information in his brain so that it becomes a solution to the deficiency of the brain and reduces brain function as a place to store information.

In the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms civilization in Indonesia, royal information such as the names of kings or stories of royal struggles is written. Imagine if this story is stored in the memories of the governors, maybe the story will not last long. And it might not be enjoyed by children and grandchildren for hundreds of years to come. However, the writing was manifested in stone which we call inscriptions and papers which when compiled into books make the age of information last longer, beyond human life.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  
  
If the internet has been discovered, maybe a royal IT expert will create a royal website and write down all the information in it. Academics owned by the kingdom will write a biography of one of the kings and write historical events and the royal officials will always record the income and expenditure of the king’s finances through word excel from his computer. All information will be recorded and read by future generations. After that, all documents will be uploaded to cloud-based storage to secure the data.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  
  
However, the human brain has not developed that far. The best technology for long-lasting data storage is still in the form of stones, tree trunks, and when it’s better to find books. In the 14th century, in the kingdom of [Majapahit](https://historia.id/kuno/articles/awal-mula-kerajaan-majapahit-D8J4o), we can find traces left in the form of books like Kakawin [Nagarakrtagama](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakawin_Nagarakretagama) by Empu Prapanca. The book makes it easy for the current generation to learn about life in Majapahit and uncover important events. This proves the availability of recorded information is very helpful in the world of research in revealing how people used to be active and working, the political and economic system, or the government system.

## When Binary Letters Meet Silicon and Transistors
At present, we are in the era of transistors, silicon, and binary numbers. Information and data can not only be recorded in writing but also images and videos. Someone who today records himself eating at a traditional flavored Javanese restaurant using his Apple smartphone and uploading it to an Instagram account will forever be a track record that can be opened 100 or 500 years later.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  
  
As one Middle Eastern expert did, who can determine where hoax news is based on images in articles that are compared to the same images in certain articles using Google Image and tracks the biodata of a terrorist child and his affiliates from his photo and social media accounts using the same method for tracking the originality of an article.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  
  
The development of human civilization can not be separated from the human ability to simplify all forms of information into two numbers, 1 and 0. Two numbers that are enough to make information last forever. With the help of the formation of an internet network that can be regarded as a worldwide network of information people become goods that are no longer valuable because the amount is very abundant. Internet networks are revolutionizing the way information spreads, the presentation of information, and the age of information. With just a few fingers touch on the smartphone layer, one can make threats to a country.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  
  
The internet, which basically uses binary numbers in its information transmission, with pulses of the speed of light transmitted through optical fibers as it is now, makes information more quickly conveyed by the construction of complex networks. This makes information can be archived to other computers.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  
  
Today we know of Cloud technology, for example, owned by large companies such as Google, Amazon, or Alibaba. If they’re used to be a library that had to be destroyed to conquer and win the war. In the future cloud server might be the main target in winning the war.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  
  
Today we cannot only store information in written form. Even pictures and moving images (video) is the best way to store information. In the past, humans used language and writing to describe the atmosphere of events around them. There can be misinterpretations there, but since humans are able to record. Information storage of an event can be directly seen without the help of human reasoning.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  
  
So what happens is eternity and ease in getting data and storing it. One day, 1,000 or 10,000 years to come to the next generation will not be difficult to explore and recognize human behavior now. All are available, all easily accessible. The abundance of information will shift the problem for the next generation from the initial allocation of energy to search to the need for more energy to assess and classify.
