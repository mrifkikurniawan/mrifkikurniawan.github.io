## It All Started From a Sewing Machine
In 1589, Queen Elizabeth I refused to grant a patent on someone’s intelligent invention, he was William Lee, who was able to model hand movements when knitting on a machine. The Queen refused on the grounds that this machine would damage the conventional textile industry. After that, 200 years later this tool revolutionized the way the textile industry worked, the machine that had been rejected by the queen to be the most used machine in all textile industries at that time. By using massively this technology, the textile industry is able to mass-produce fabric in a faster time. This then became the most important momentum in initiating the first industrial revolution.

Late in the 18th century, to be exact, the first industrial revolution took place. This event has inherited steam technology and engine-based power that can replace the strength of human muscle. This first industrial revolution was based on Newton’s discovery when formulating the law of motion. Since then, the motion can be better understood and measured, which then allows humans to make steam engines that can mechanize the work previously done by humans [(Xing and Marwala, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09643). This first industrial revolution can be said to be the birth of a machine.

Great Britain became the first region to face this revolutionary change which later spread to Europe and America. This change has penetrated every aspect of life, not apart from the jobs and occupations which then changed the entire social order and psychology of society.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
  
  
The lower-middle-class workers who rely more on the ability of muscles replaced by the machines. The first industrial revolution resulted in at least 1/3 of the total workers were laid off no work and another 1/3 working part-time because of the ability to work have been taken over by machines. The utilization of the steam machines increases the need for coal which then raises the problem most often discussed today, global warming.

  The rate of birth and death of the population during and after the industrial revolution <a href="https://www.oup.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/58031/Oxford-Big-Ideas-Geography-History-9-ch5-Industrial-revolution.pdf">(Easton, 2013).</a>
</p>

From the demographic aspect, in 1750 the number of British people 6.5 million people increased by 400% in 1990 to 32.5 million people. In 1750, 80% of rural people lived in villages and 20% of people lived in cities, turned 180 degrees in 1850, 80% of people lived in cities and 20% of people lived in villages. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
  
    
The habit of the people who initially farmed and relied on food and food supplies from agricultural products turned into an industrial labor society working in factories and offices. Up to now, we can see the impact of the industrial revolution from the phenomenon of urbanization and dominated employment patterns in the industrial sector.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
  
  
## The Material Revolution and the Mobilization Revolution
100 years later, [Sir Henry Bessemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Bessemer) discovered a new method of making steel from molten scrap metal. This method revolutionized steel manufacturing to be cheaper, increase the scale and speed of production, and reduce the need for workers in their manufacture [(Mokyr, 1998)](https://en-econ.tau.ac.il/sites/economy_en.tau.ac.il/files/media_server/Economics/PDF/Mini%20courses/castronovo.pdf).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
As a result, the mass production of steel took place. Steel replaces iron which is proven to be weaker and more expensive. Steel which is proven to be cheaper and more durable enables the construction of railroad lines to be cheap, as a result, the acceleration of its construction can no longer be avoided. The existence of railroads and development that is increasingly equitable changes the pattern and intensity of transportation and supply chains which results in a decrease in commodity prices such as coal and steel.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
 
  
This transportation system also revolutionized the mobilization of all things, including in the dissemination of information and knowledge. This discovery allows more humans to migrate for certain purposes such as learning. This then also changes how science and technology spread. Because the cheaper the means of transportation, the more easily accessible transportation, the more people and goods move at an affordable price. As a result, economic growth has increased and competency and expertise have also increased.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
[Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday) and [Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell) accelerated this two-volume industrial revolution through their magnetic and electrical forces which created the generation of electricity and electromagnetism that are widely used in industrial systems in the future ([Xing and Marwala, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09643)). This electricity supports the industry for mass production ([Schwab, 2016](https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Industrial-Revolution-Professor-Dr-Ing-ebook/dp/B01JEMROIU)).  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
 
  
Electrification is also the cause of the creation of major changes in industrial production methods, which are called the assembly line and mass production. Elective also gives the industry the ability to be able to work for 24 hours without stopping. This means that work time is also increasing for employees. They can work up to 10–16 hours a day. This brings workers to bad conditions such as low wages, poor working conditions (poor lighting, and no machine safety). This results in widespread poverty and very high depression.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
  
  
## Communication Revolution
Rapid mobilization has accelerated the spread of science and technology. The next era is the era of [transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor). The transistor initiated the invention of computers and the internet. Transistors have led humans to the invention of computers that have become the fastest data processing machines ever. In the same era, the internet was discovered, the most massive distributor of information could be realized. The internet is changing the way humans spread information and knowledge.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
 
> Energy has become the basis of the second industrial revolution, while the third industrial revolution is the era of information and knowledge  
  
Letters used to be very useful in sending news or spreading information. It takes days and even months to wait for a letter to be delivered to a specific destination. At that time the inter-mail system was still a unity with the transportation system, so the letter was very dependent on the development of the transportation system. Likewise knowledge, someone needs to go overseas and travel hundreds of kilometers to meet a teacher and get knowledge from him. After that, just back to the area to disseminate the knowledge gained. However, since the discovery of the internet, everything has changed. It only takes a few minutes for information to be conveyed. Content and science books available on computer servers on the internet can be downloaded and studied with just one or two clicks. The internet makes the earth turn faster.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
 
  
Acceleration of knowledge has implications for the acceleration of innovation. This era makes the machine capable of sensing and making decisions individually. Computer technology takes the machine to the next generation, namely machine automation. Computers carrying machines in the industry can work without human control in accordance with what has been programmed by humans. At that time, data and information transfers were only limited to one factory system.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
Intersystem data transfer is still not possible due to limitations in data transmission technology. Next is the era in which these systems communicate with each other and each individual system is able to learn and develop like humans. What was this era like?  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
## Industrial Revolution 4.0
Today, we are at the end of industry 3.0 and are on a journey of transition to a change in industry style that we could not have foreseen, the cyber-physical industry 4.0. The third industrial revolution has been able to make the glass doors of offices open automatically or to be able to close the reservoir water in our homes when fully charged. Then what time will we face after this?  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
Imagine if we are leaving for work, then you call the car you have through a smartphone to take you and stop right in front of you. On the trip, you enjoy a cup of coffee that has been provided by the coffee maker every morning in your car and access the latest information through the screen projected on the windshield of your car. Meanwhile, your car is moving at a steady speed with self-driving capability without stopping due to traffic lights.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
Yes, each car is able to communicate with each other so that it allows them to go without colliding. Such is the picture of industry 4.0 when all things have been made automatically, the next step is to make them able to communicate with each other like humans reprimand their friends when they meet or stay away from those who have problems with their health.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
 
  
In 2011 at an event titled “Hannover Mesese” the German government launched a completely new concept of the future of the industry. Digitalization of manufacturing was adopted as the theme which became the basis of this future industrial concept, they named it “Industrie 4.0”. The academics and business leaders who poured the concept did not know that the concept would spread quickly and become a future industrial concept of the world. 5 years later, the concept became viral and was widely discussed at conferences and seminars related to the concept of the future industry.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  
 
  
Industry 4.0 is a new paradigm in the revolutionary way of industry. This paradigm creates the realization of integration and interconnection between machines, products, components, individuals, and information technology that are united in industrial systems. Integration, interconnection, and flexibility are the principles that this series of four industrial revolutions will bring. The fourth industrial revolution can be said to be machines that can communicate with each other.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
This interaction allows traffic lights located in East Surabaya to communicate with traffic lights in West Surabaya to resolve traffic jams during work hours. Industry 4.0 can be said to be the next digitization of the manufacturing sector, which is controlled by 4 things: **data empowerment, computing power, and connections**; **analytical and business intelligence capabilities**; **new ways of human interaction with machines such as touch layers and Augmented Reality**; and **increased transfer of data instructions to the physical world such as robotics and 3D printers** (Lee et al., 2013).

  Industry Principles 4.0 (Cohen et al., 2017).
</p>

  
In industry 4.0, data will be the most valuable. Data in the form of numbers and letters that can be interpreted into information. This interpretation will be very useful in making decisions resulting from the processing of AI or Machine Learning. E-Commerce currently for example has used data to predict demand and determine the price of goods in accordance with the number of requests and purchases that are continuously monitored from the virtual activities of its customers. This is evidence of the realization of flexibility in industry 4.0 and business principles that are customer-oriented by understanding the behavior and activities of customers.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
In the industrial era 4.0, technology development will refer to the fields of genetics, biotechnology, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and 3D printing (World Economic Forum, 2016). These technologies enable humans to work more efficiently and cheaper than they ever have. Artificial intelligence, for example, allows a computer to make decisions like an expert or expert system.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
If humans can realize this, then authenticity will quickly be distributed to all computers and machines. The ability of experts to predict the surge in demand for goods or the value of the most appropriate goods is easily applied and disseminated. We only need a hardware device that has sensors and is connected to the internet (IoT). Then the AI software that is installed on hardware downloaded through the internet will manage that data to be the most effective and efficient expert decision ever made.

## From Centralization Towards Decentralization
These years maybe the company’s production operations are still centralized. In this case, they need a fast distribution system to send their products. However, the next few years 3D printing will change it. 3D printing allows an automotive factory to produce goods in places that are affordable to customers. This will be able to minimize the distribution budget from the previous era.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
Prediction using AI will enable companies to determine the best production points, complete with the number of items needed by the customer at that time. Here, 3D printers that have been placed at certain points will work according to requests sent from AI processed data. Each printer works according to the design that the company has sent to its software through a fiber optic communication network that connects the points of the production plant.  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
Changes in the pattern of production that are centralized in one point of production into a number of points of production which is a forecast of future production patterns. Each machine installed with AI software or machine learning will be able to make decisions individually based on centralized collective data (integration).  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
So that intelligent machines this time will be able to replace not only menial work but also the ability of logic and human thinking. The World Economic Forum with BVL International predicts the impact of the fourth industrial revolution on certain sectors such as employment, manufacturing and industry, supply chain, services and business models, and the company’s relationship with customers. Industry 4.0 will change the most essential things that humans have ([Schwab, 2016](https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Industrial-Revolution-Professor-Dr-Ing-ebook/dp/B01JEMROIU)).  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}  

  
> Then what about humans? Are they ready to beat the expertise of machines and robots or even get rid of the robots they make?
