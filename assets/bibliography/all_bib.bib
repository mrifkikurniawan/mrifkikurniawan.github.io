abstract = {Humans excel at continually learning from an ever-changing environment whereas it remains a challenge for deep neural networks which exhibit catastrophic forgetting. The complementary learning system (CLS) theory suggests that the interplay between rapid instance-based learning and slow structured learning in the brain is crucial for accumulating and retaining knowledge. Here, we propose CLS-ER, a novel dual memory experience replay (ER) method which maintains short-term and long-term semantic memories that interact with the episodic memory. Our method employs an effective replay mechanism whereby new knowledge is acquired while aligning the decision boundaries with the semantic memories. CLS-ER does not utilize the task boundaries or make any assumption about the distribution of the data which makes it versatile and suited for "general continual learning". Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks as well as more realistic general continual learning settings.},

abstract = {Accurate wind speed forecasting, which strongly influences the safe usage of wind resources, is still a critical issue and a huge challenge. At present, the single-valued deterministic NWP forecast is primarily adopted by wind farms; however, recent techniques cannot meet the actual needs of grid dispatch in many cases. This paper contributes to a new multi-step forecasting method for operational wind forecast, 96-steps of the next day, termed the CS-FS-WRF-E model, which is based on a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) ensemble forecast, a novel Fuzzy System, and a Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. First, the WRF ensemble, which considers three horizontal resolutions and four initial fields, using a 0.5Â° horizontal grid-spacing Global Forecast System (GFS) model output, is constructed as the basic forecasting results. Then, a novel fuzzy system, which can extract the features of these ensembles, is built under the concept of membership degrees. With the help of CS optimization, the final model is constructed using this evolutionary algorithm to adjust and correct the results obtained based on physical laws, yielding the best forecasting performance and outperforming individual ensemble members and all of the other models for comparison.},

abstract = {Despite significant advances, continual learning models still suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to incrementally available data from non-stationary distributions. Rehearsal approaches alleviate the problem by maintaining and replaying a small episodic memory of previous samples, often implemented as an array of independent memory slots. In this work, we propose to augment such an array with a learnable random graph that captures pairwise similarities between its samples, and use it not only to learn new tasks but also to guard against forgetting. Empirical results on several benchmark datasets show that our model consistently outperforms recently proposed baselines for task-free continual learning.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that attackers can force deep learning models to misclassify so-called 'adversarial examples:' maliciously generated images formed by making imperceptible modifications to pixel values. With growing interest in deep learning for security applications, it is important for security experts and users of machine learning to recognize how learning systems may be attacked. Due to the complex nature of deep learning, it is challenging to understand how deep models can be fooled by adversarial examples. Thus, we present a web-based visualization tool, Adversarial-Playground, to demonstrate the efficacy of common adversarial methods against a convolutional neural network (CNN) system. Adversarial-Playground is educational, modular and interactive. (1) It enables non-experts to compare examples visually and to understand why an adversarial example can fool a CNN-based image classifier. (2) It can help security experts explore more vulnerability of deep learning as a software module. (3) Building an interactive visualization is challenging in this domain due to the large feature space of image classification (generating adversarial examples is slow in general and visualizing images are costly). Through multiple novel design choices, our tool can provide fast and accurate responses to user requests. Empirically, we find that our client-server division strategy reduced the response time by an average of 1.5 seconds per sample. Our other innovation, a faster variant of JSMA evasion algorithm, empirically performed twice as fast as JSMA and yet maintains a comparable evasion rate1.},

abstract = {The word any may appear in some sentences, but not in others. For example, any is permitted in sentences that contain the word nobody, as in Nobody ate any fruit. However, in a minimally different context any seems strikingly anomalous: Everybody ate any fruit. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the brain responds to the word any in such minimally different contexts - where it is permitted (licensed) and where it is not permitted (unlicensed). Brain responses were measured from adult readers using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The results showed significantly larger responses to permissible contexts in the left posterior temporal areas between 400-500ms and 590-660ms. These results clarify the anatomy and timing of brain processes that contribute to our judgment that a word such as any is or is not permitted in a given context. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Connectionist networks in which information is stored in weights on connections among simple processing units have attracted considerable interest in cognitive science. Much of the interest centers around two characteristics of these networks. First, the weights on connections between units need not be prewired by the model builder but rather may be established through training in which items to be learned are presented repeatedly to the network and the connection weights are adjusted in small increments according to a learning algorithm. Second, the networks may represent information in a distributed fashion. This chapter discusses the catastrophic interference in connectionist networks. Distributed representations established through the application of learning algorithms have several properties that are claimed to be desirable from the standpoint of modeling human cognition. These properties include content-addressable memory and so-called automatic generalization in which a network trained on a set of items responds correctly to other untrained items within the same domain. New learning may interfere catastrophically with old learning when networks are trained sequentially. The analysis of the causes of interference implies that at least some interference will occur whenever new learning may alter weights involved in representing old learning, and the simulation results demonstrate only that interference is catastrophic in some specific networks. {\textcopyright} 1989 Academic Press Inc.},

In real-world applications, the data available to train these networks is often limited or imbalanced. We propose a sampling method based on the radial transform in a polar coordinate system for image augmentation to facilitate the training of deep learning models from limited source data. This pixel-wise transform provides representations of the original image in the polar coordinate system by generating a new image from each pixel. This technique can generate radial transformed images up to the number of pixels in the original image to increase the diversity of poorly represented image classes.

abstract = {Objective: Patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are difficult to diagnose and they represent a very heterogeneous group. Some require immediate treatment while others, with only minor disorders, may be sent home. Detecting ACS patients using a machine learning approach would be advantageous in many situations. Methods and materials: Artificial neural network (ANN) ensembles and logistic regression models were trained on data from 634 patients presenting an emergency department with chest pain. Only data immediately available at patient presentation were used, including electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The models were analyzed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, calibration assessments, inter- and intra-method variations. Effective odds ratios for the ANN ensembles were compared with the odds ratios obtained from the logistic model. Results: The ANN ensemble approach together with ECG data preprocessed using principal component analysis resulted in an area under the ROC curve of 80%. At the sensitivity of 95% the specificity was 41%, corresponding to a negative predictive value of 97%, given the ACS prevalence of 21%. Adding clinical data available at presentation did not improve the ANN ensemble performance. Using the area under the ROC curve and model calibration as measures of performance we found an advantage using the ANN ensemble models compared to the logistic regression models. Conclusion: Clinically, a prediction model of the present type, combined with the judgment of trained emergency department personnel, could be useful for the early discharge of chest pain patients in populations with a low prevalence of ACS. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting affects the training of neural networks, limiting their ability to learn multiple tasks sequentially. From the perspective of the well established plasticity-stability dilemma, neural networks tend to be overly plastic, lacking the stability necessary to prevent the forgetting of previous knowledge, which means that as learning progresses, networks tend to forget previously seen tasks. This phenomenon coined in the continual learning literature, has attracted much attention lately, and several families of approaches have been proposed with different degrees of success. However, there has been limited prior work extensively analyzing the impact that different training regimes -- learning rate, batch size, regularization method-- can have on forgetting. In this work, we depart from the typical approach of altering the learning algorithm to improve stability. Instead, we hypothesize that the geometrical properties of the local minima found for each task play an important role in the overall degree of forgetting. In particular, we study the effect of dropout, learning rate decay, and batch size, on forming training regimes that widen the tasks' local minima and consequently, on helping it not to forget catastrophically. Our study provides practical insights to improve stability via simple yet effective techniques that outperform alternative baselines.},

An increasing need for generating the entire conditional distribution of future observations has been required for the new generation of soft sensors. This study aims the probabilistic forecasts, reporting the use of a hybrid fuzzy forecasting model applied in two different forecasting problems. Our adapted model is applied to predict the rain of the city of Vitoria, in the state of EspÂ´ Ä±rito Santo, Brazil. Real data from a wind farm, provided by the Irish EirGrid institute, was used for analyzing the proposal over a real time series with high fluctuations. Due to the stochasticity of the the hybrid model, which is calibrated through the use of an evolutionary metaheuristic, we adapted it in order to generate future using quantile regression. Computational experiments indicated the ability of the model in finding useful probabilistic quantiles, which were flexible enough in order to limit the lower and upper bounds of the historical datasets. While the probabilistic quantiles suggested the probability of rain and its magnitude, they were also able to predict expected ranges of the amount of energy generated from the wind farm.},

abstract = {Neural networks are often represented as graphs of connections between neurons. However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a "sweet spot" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks. Our work opens new directions for the design of neural architectures and the understanding on neural networks in general.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a fuzzy-preconditioned ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model for electricity price forecasting. The deregulated electric power systems have been widely spread to trade electric power through electric power markets. The market players are interested in gaining the inside track to maximize the profits and minimize risks in advance. One of the most important tasks is how to forecast a complicated time series of electricity price that affects transmission network congestion. In practice, it is hard to forecast electricity price with the spikes due to the high nonlinearity. In this paper, GRBFN (General Radial Basis Function Network) of ANN is proposed for electricity price forecasting. It is an extension of RBFN of ANN in a way that the optimal parameters of the Gaussian functions are determined by the learning process in RBFN. To improve the model accuracy of GRBFN, FCE (fuzzy c-Elliptotypes) is introduced into GRBFN as a fuzzy precondition technique. FCE is an extension of FCM (fuzzy c-means) and plays a key role to classify input data into fuzzy clusters. The use of FCE contributes to the improvement of model accuracy for spikes of electricity price that bring about much higher price. This paper makes use of DA clustering to evaluate a better initial solution of the parameters of the Gaussian functions. Also, EPSO of evolutionary computation is used to evaluate better weights between neurons. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of electricity price.},

abstract = {Audio Description (AD) provides linguistic descriptions of movies and allows visually impaired people to follow a movie along with their peers. Such descriptions are by design mainly visual and thus naturally form an interesting data source for computer vision and computational linguistics. In this work we propose a novel dataset which contains transcribed ADs, which are temporally aligned to full length movies. In addition we also collected and aligned movie scripts used in prior work and compare the two sources of descriptions. In total the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) contains a parallel corpus of 118,114 sentences and video clips from 202 movies. First we characterize the dataset by benchmarking different approaches for generating video descriptions. Comparing ADs to scripts, we find that ADs are indeed more visual and describe precisely what is shown rather than what should happen according to the scripts created prior to movie production. Furthermore, we present and compare the results of several teams who participated in a challenge organized in the context of the workshop "Describing and Understanding Video & The Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC)", at ICCV 2015.},

abstract = {Recent studies reveal that a deep neural network can learn transferable features which generalize well to novel tasks for domain adaptation. However, as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the network, the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with increasing domain discrepancy. Hence, it is important to formally reduce the dataset bias and enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this paper, we propose a new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture, which generalizes deep convolutional neural network to the domain adaptation scenario. In DAN, hidden representations of all task-specific layers are embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embeddings of different domain distributions can be explicitly matched. The domain discrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multi-kernel selection method for mean embedding matching. DAN can learn transferable features with statistical guarantees, and can scale linearly by unbiased estimate of kernel embedding. Extensive empirical evidence shows that the proposed architecture yields state-of-the-art image classification error rates on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.},

Experiments reveal that our multi-layer combination of many models offers better use of allocated training time than seeking out the best. A second contribution is an extensive evaluation of public and commercial AutoML platforms including TPOT, H2O, AutoWEKA, auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and Google AutoML Tables. Tests on a suite of 50 classification and regression tasks from Kaggle and the OpenML AutoML Benchmark reveal that AutoGluon is faster, more robust, and much more accurate. We find that AutoGluon often even outperforms the best-in-hindsight combination of all of its competitors.

In common image shifting, cropping, flipping, shearing and rotating are used for augmentation. But there are more advanced techniques like Cutout and SamplePairing. In this work we present two improvements of the state-of-the-art Cutout and SamplePairing techniques. Our new method called Copyout takes a square patch of another random training image and copies it onto a random location of each image used for training. The second technique we discovered is called CopyPairing. It combines Copyout and SamplePairing for further augmentation and even better performance. We apply different experiments with these augmentation techniques on the CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate and compare them under different configurations. In our experiments we show that Copyout reduces the test error rate by 8.18% compared with Cutout and 4.27% compared with SamplePairing. CopyPairing reduces the test error rate by 11.97% compared with Cutout and 8.21% compared with SamplePairing.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore African American women's attitudes toward cosmetics, how women use cosmetics, and how use of the products is related to African American women's self-identity and self-perception of appearance. The sample was 18 African American women who were residents of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, or Ames, Iowa. Recruitment was done by placing announcements about the study on the university Minority Students Office and Southeast Arkansas African American professional listserve. In-depth interviews were conducted with each woman. The women began wearing cosmetics at different periods in their lives during childhood, or adolescence. Shopping for cosmetics could be a hassle for some participants. Some reported difficulties in finding the right foundation to match their skin complexion. Many participants believed that finding cosmetics was a hit-or-miss experience when it came to shopping for cheaper cosmetics in local stores. Working with a consultant at a department store counter improved the experience. Stores in the predominantly White Iowa location carried few cosmetics appropriate for African American women's skin colors, causing much frustration on the part of the respondents in that location. Many of the women spent more money on quality cosmetics products that they felt made them look better and caused fewer skin problems. Many of the participants preferred the same brand of higher-end cosmetics. The women actively searched for YouTube tutorials to learn new tricks and techniques on how to apply their cosmetics. For many of the women, wearing cosmetics is a form of 'magic' that enhanced their beauty and self-confidence. Many of the women explained that applying cosmetics was needed to enhance their features; for a few, makeup was seen as unnecessary, but a nice addition. All used cosmetics to present an idealized appearance and enjoyed wearing them. The women in Arkansas made greater use of cosmetics on a daily basis, perhaps because of their work versus student roles and location in a larger African American community. Social comparison, self-objectification, and symbolic self-completion theories were useful in interpreting the findings. Black feminist perspectives considering personal power and issues of inclusion and exclusion in media and retail settings were also incorporated in the analysis.

abstract = {Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

abstract = {Machine learning classifiers are often trained to recognize a set of pre-defined classes. However, in many applications, it is often desirable to have the flexibility of learning additional concepts, with limited data and without re-training on the full training set. This paper addresses this problem, incremental few-shot learning, where a regular classification network has already been trained to recognize a set of base classes, and several extra novel classes are being considered, each with only a few labeled examples. After learning the novel classes, the model is then evaluated on the overall classification performance on both base and novel classes. To this end, we propose a meta-learning model, the Attention Attractor Network, which regularizes the learning of novel classes. In each episode, we train a set of new weights to recognize novel classes until they converge, and we show that the technique of recurrent back-propagation can back-propagate through the optimization process and facilitate the learning of these parameters. We demonstrate that the learned attractor network can help recognize novel classes while remembering old classes without the need to review the original training set, outperforming various baselines.},

This paper presents a new methodology focusing on the improvement of the short-term prediction that combines the advantages of both approaches and that can be applied in the early stages of a diffusion process. An application of the methodology is also illustrated, providing short-term forecasts for the world broadband and mobile telecommunications' penetration. The results reveal that the methodology is capable of producing improved one-year-ahead predictions, after a certain level of penetration, as compared to the results of both methods individually. This methodology can find applications to all cases of the high-technology market, where a diffusion model is usually used for obtaining future forecasts.

abstract = {Intersection over Union (IoU) is the most popular evaluation metric used in the object detection benchmarks. However, there is a gap between optimizing the commonly used distance losses for regressing the parameters of a bounding box and maximizing this metric value. The optimal objective for a metric is the metric itself. In the case of axis-aligned 2D bounding boxes, it can be shown that IoU can be directly used as a regression loss. However, IoU has a plateau making it infeasible to optimize in the case of non-overlapping bounding boxes. In this paper, we address the this weakness by introducing a generalized version of IoU as both a new loss and a new metric. By incorporating this generalized IoU ( GIoU) as a loss into the state-of-the art object detection frameworks, we show a consistent improvement on their performance using both the standard, IoU based, and new, GIoU based, performance measures on popular object detection benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.},

abstract = {The growing energy and performance costs of deep learning have driven the community to reduce the size of neural networks by selectively pruning components. Similarly to their biological counterparts, sparse networks generalize just as well, if not better than, the original dense networks. Sparsity can reduce the memory footprint of regular networks to fit mobile devices, as well as shorten training time for ever growing networks. In this paper, we survey prior work on sparsity in deep learning and provide an extensive tutorial of sparsification for both inference and training. We describe approaches to remove and add elements of neural networks, different training strategies to achieve model sparsity, and mechanisms to exploit sparsity in practice. Our work distills ideas from more than 300 research papers and provides guidance to practitioners who wish to utilize sparsity today, as well as to researchers whose goal is to push the frontier forward. We include the necessary background on mathematical methods in sparsification, describe phenomena such as early structure adaptation, the intricate relations between sparsity and the training process, and show techniques for achieving acceleration on real hardware. We also define a metric of pruned parameter efficiency that could serve as a baseline for comparison of different sparse networks. We close by speculating on how sparsity can improve future workloads and outline major open problems in the field.},

The key to dealing with the unfamiliar or novel category is to transfer knowledge obtained from familiar classes to describe the unfamiliar class. In this paper, we build upon the recently introduced Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and propose an approach that uses both semantic embeddings and the categorical relationships to predict the classifiers. Given a learned knowledge graph (KG), our approach takes as input semantic embeddings for each node (representing visual category). After a series of graph convolutions, we predict the visual classifier for each category. During training, the visual classifiers for a few categories are given to learn the GCN parameters. At test time, these filters are used to predict the visual classifiers of unseen categories. We show that our approach is robust to noise in the KG. More importantly, our approach provides significant improvement in performance compared to the current state-of-the-art results (from 2 $\sim$ 3% on some metrics to whopping 20% on a few).},

We leverage the natural temporal coherency of color to create a model that learns to colorize gray-scale videos by copying colors from a reference frame. Quantitative and qualitative experiments suggest that this task causes the model to automatically learn to track visual regions. Although the model is trained without any ground-truth labels, our method learns to track well enough to outperform the latest methods based on optical flow. Moreover, our results suggest that failures to track are correlated with failures to colorize, indicating that advancing video colorization may further improve self-supervised visual tracking.},

The fastest MLP training algorithm, that is the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, is used for optimization of the network weights for data from two stations on the Tongue River in Montana, USA. The first part of the study deals with prediction and estimation of upstream and down-stream station sediment data, separately, and the second part focuses on the estimation of downstream suspended sediment data by using data from both stations. In each case, the MLP test results are compared to those of generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), radial basis function (RBF) and multi-linear regression (MLR) for the best-input combinations. Based on the comparisons, it was found that the MLP generally gives better suspended sediment concentration estimates than the other neural network techniques and the conventional statistical method (MLR).

It extends the results of Kn{\"{u}}ppel (2014) in order to relax the condition on the data structure that is required for the SUR estimator to be independent of unknown quantities. It turns out that the SUR estimator of the forecast uncertainty, which estimates the forecast uncertainty for all horizons jointly, tends to deliver large efficiency gains relative to the OLS estimator (i.e., the sample mean of the squared forecast errors for each individual horizon) in the case of increased forecast horizons. The SUR estimator is applied to the forecast errors of the Bank of England, the US Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the FOMC.},

In this work, we introduce a new training strategy, iCaRL, that allows learning in such a class-incremental way: only the training data for a small number of classes has to be present at the same time and new classes can be added progressively. iCaRL learns strong classifiers and a data representation simultaneously. This distinguishes it from earlier works that were fundamentally limited to fixed data representations and therefore incompatible with deep learning architectures. We show by experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 data that iCaRL can learn many classes incrementally over a long period of time where other strategies quickly fail.},

This paradigm has also been adopted by the theory of artificial neural networks. Recent physiological experiments demonstrate, however, that in many parts of the nervous system, neural code is founded on the timing of individual action potentials. This finding has given rise to the emergence of a new class of neural models, called spiking neural networks. In this paper we summarize basic properties of spiking neurons and spiking networks. Our focus is, specifically, on models of spike-based information coding, synaptic plasticity and learning. We also survey real-life applications of spiking models. The paper is meant to be an introduction to spiking neural networks for scientists from various disciplines interested in spike-based neural processing.},

abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art finetuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

abstract = {An important challenge for neural networks is to learn incre- mentally, i.e., learn new classes without catastrophic forget- ting. To overcome this problem, generative replay technique has been suggested, which can generate samples belonging to learned classes while learning new ones. However, such generative models usually suffer from increased distribution mismatch between the generated and original samples along the learning process. In this work, we propose DeepCollabo- ration (D-Collab), a collaborative framework of deep gener- ative and discriminative models to solve this problem effec- tively. We develop a discriminative learning model to incre- mentally update the latent feature space for continual classi- fication. At the same time, a generative model is introduced to achieve conditional generation using the latent feature dis- tribution produced by the discriminative model. Important- ly, the generative and discriminative models are connected through bidirectional training to enforce cycle-consistency of mappings between feature and image domains. Furthermore, a domain alignment module is used to eliminate the diver- gence between the feature distributions of generated images and real ones. This module together with the discriminative model can perform effective sample mining to achieve effi- cient incremental learning. Extensive experiments on several visual recognition datasets show that our system can achieve state-of-the-art performance. 1},

The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

The features are pre-trained on a large dataset without human annotation and later transferred via fine-tuning on a different, smaller and labeled dataset. The pre-training consists of solving jigsaw puzzles of natural images. To facilitate the transfer of features to other tasks, we introduce the context-free network (CFN), a siamese-ennead convolutional neural network. The features correspond to the columns of the CFN and they process image tiles independently (i.e., free of context). The later layers of the CFN then use the features to identify their geometric arrangement. Our experimental evaluations show that the learned features capture semantically relevant content. We pre-train the CFN on the training set of the ILSVRC2012 dataset and transfer the features on the combined training and validation set of Pascal VOC 2007 for object detection (via fast RCNN) and classification. These features outperform all current unsupervised features with 51.8% for detection and 68.6% for classification, and reduce the gap with supervised learning (56.5% and 78.2% respectively).},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks define an exceptionally powerful class of models, but are still limited by the lack of ability to be spatially invariant to the input data in a computationally and parameter efficient manner. In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},

abstract = {Passive millimeter wave imaging often suffers from issues such as low resolution, noise, and blurring. In this study, a blind image restoration method for the passive millimeter-wave images (PMMW) is proposed. The purpose of the proposed method is to simultaneously solve the point spread function (PSF) and restoration image. In this method, the data fidelity item is constructed based on Gaussian noise assuming, and the regularization item is constructed as the hyper-Laplace function ||x||0.6, which is fitted according to the high-resolution PMMW images. Moreover, a data-selected matrix is proposed to select the regions that are helpful for estimating the accurate PSF. The proposed method has been applied to simulated and real PMMW image experiments. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art deblurring methods on both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The proposed method improves the resolution of the PMMW image and makes it more preferable for object recognition.},

abstract = {Within classic time series approaches, a time series model can be studied under 3 groups, namely AR (autoregressive model), MA (moving averages model) and ARMA (autoregressive moving averages model). On the other hand, solutions are based mostly on fuzzy AR time series models in the fuzzy time series literature. However, just a few fuzzy ARMA time series models have proposed until now. Fuzzy AR time series models have been divided into two groups named first order and high order models in the literature, highlighting the impact of model degree on forecast performance. However, model structure has been disregarded in these fuzzy AR models. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate the model specification error arising from not utilizing of MA variables in the fuzzy time series approaches. For this reason, a new high order fuzzy ARMA(p,q) time series solution algorithm based on fuzzy logic group relations including fuzzy MA variables along with fuzzy AR variables has been proposed in this study. The main purpose of this article is to show that the forecast performance can be significantly improved when the deficiency of not utilizing MA variables. The other aim is also to show that the proposed method is better than the other fuzzy ARMA time series models in the literature from the point of forecast performance. Therefore, the new proposed method has been compared regarding forecast performance against some methods commonly used in literature by applying them on gold prices in Turkey, Istanbul Stock Exchange (IMKB) and the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX).},

@article{Bertugli2020,
abstract = {In real-world applications, data do not reflect the ones commonly used for neural networks training, since they are usually few, unbalanced, unlabeled and can be available as a stream. Hence many existing deep learning solutions suffer from a limited range of applications, in particular in the case of online streaming data that evolve over time. To narrow this gap, in this work we introduce a novel and complex setting involving unsupervised meta-continual learning with unbalanced tasks. These tasks are built through a clustering procedure applied to a fitted embedding space. We exploit a meta-learning scheme that simultaneously alleviates catastrophic forgetting and favors the generalization to new tasks, even Out-of-Distribution ones. Moreover, to encourage feature reuse during the meta-optimization, we exploit a single inner loop taking advantage of an aggregated representation achieved through the use of a self-attention mechanism. Experimental results on few-shot learning benchmarks show competitive performance even compared to the supervised case. Additionally, we empirically observe that in an unsupervised scenario, the small tasks and the variability in the clusters pooling play a crucial role in the generalization capability of the network. Further, on complex datasets, the exploitation of more clusters than the true number of classes leads to higher results, even compared to the ones obtained with full supervision, suggesting that a predefined partitioning into classes can miss relevant structural information.},

Having screened the catalytic performance of ZrO2loaded with different K-compounds, 32% KOH loaded on ZrO2was chosen. The catalyst was prepared using incipient wetness impregnation method. Following drying (after impregnation) and calcination at 530 C for 5 h, the catalyst was characterized by means of Hammett indicators, XRD, FTIR, SEM, TGA and N2adsorption desorption measurements. It was found that the yield of the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) was related to the catalyst base strength. The catalyst had granular and porous structures with high basicity and superior catalytic performance for the transesterification reaction. Maximum yield (90.8%) was obtained at 15:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 6% catalyst amount, 60 C reaction temperature in 2 h. The catalyst maintained sustained activity after five times of usage. The oxidative stability and iodine value were the only unsuitable properties of the biodiesel (out of range) but can easily be improved. The cetane number, flash point and the cold flow properties among others were however, comparable to international standards. The study indicated that KOH(32%)/ZrO2-5 is an economically, suitable catalyst for producing biodiesel from S. marianum oil which is a potential new non-edible feedstock that can contribute positively to biodiesel industry as its biodiesel can be rated as promising alternate fuel. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Zadeh1975,
abstract = {By a linguistic variable we mean a variable whose values are words or sentences in a natural or artificial language. For example, Age is a linguistic variable if its values are linguistic rather than numerical, i.e.,young, not young, very young, quite young, old, not very old and not very young, etc., rather than 20, 21,22, 23, In more specific terms, a linguistic variable is characterized by a quintuple (L>, T(L), U,G,M) in which L is the name of the variable; T(L) is the term-set of L, that is, the collection of its linguistic values; U is a universe of discourse; G is a syntactic rule which generates the terms in T(L); and M is a semantic rule which associates with each linguistic value X its meaning, M(X), where M(X) denotes a fuzzy subset of U. The meaning of a linguistic value X is characterized by a compatibility function, c: U 0,1, which associates with each u in U its compatibility with X. Thus, the compatibility of age 27 with young might be 0.7, while that of 35 might be 0.2. The function of the semantic rule is to relate the compatibilities of the so-called primary terms in a composite linguistic value-e.g., young and old in not very young and not very old-to the compatibility of the composite value. To this end, the hedges such as very, quite, extremely, etc., as well as the connectives and and or are treated as nonlinear operators which modify the meaning of their operands in a specified fashion. The concept of a linguistic variable provides a means of approximate characterization of phenomena which are too complex or too ill-defined to be amenable to description in conventional quantitative terms. In particular, treating Truth as a linguistic variable with values such as true, very true, completely true, not very true, untrue, etc., leads to what is called fuzzy logic. By providing a basis for approximate reasoning, that is, a mode of reasoning which is not exact nor very inexact, such logic may offer a more realistic framework for human reasoning than the traditional two-valued logic. It is shown that probabilities, too, can be treated as linguistic variables with values such as likely, very likely, unlikely, etc. Computation with linguistic probabilities requires the solution of nonlinear programs and leads to results which are imprecise to the same degree as the underlying probabilities. The main applications of the linguistic approach lie in the realm of humanistic systems-especially in the fields of artificial intelligence, linguistics, human decision processes, pattern recognition, psychology, law, medical diagnosis, information retrieval, economics and related areas.},

abstract = {Speed optimization of liner vessels has significant economic and environmental impact for reducing fuel cost and Green House Gas (GHG) emission as the shipping over maritime logistics takes more than 70% of world transportation. While slow steaming is widely used as best practices for liner shipping companies, they are also under the pressure to maintain service level agreement (SLA) with their cargo clients. Thus, deciding optimal speed that minimizes fuel consumption while maintaining SLA is managerial decision problem. Studies in the literature use theoretical fuel consumption functions in their speed optimization models but these functions have limitations due to weather conditions in voyages. This paper uses weather archive data to estimate the real fuel consumption function for speed optimization problems. In particular, Copernicus data set is used as the source of big data and data mining technique is applied to identify the impact of weather conditions based on a given voyage route. Particle swarm optimization, a metaheuristic optimization method, is applied to find Pareto optimal solutions that minimize fuel consumption and maximize SLA. The usefulness of the proposed approach is verified through the real data obtained from a liner company and real world implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Large-scale and multidimensional spatiotemporal data sets are becoming ubiquitous in many real-world applications such as monitoring urban traffic and air quality. Making predictions on these time series has become a critical challenge due to not only the large-scale and high-dimensional nature but also the considerable amount of missing data. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian temporal factorization (BTF) framework for modeling multidimensional time seriesâin particular spatiotemporal dataâin the presence of missing values. By integrating low-rank matrix/tensor factorization and vector autoregressive (VAR) process into a single probabilistic graphical model, this framework can characterize both global and local consistencies in large-scale time series data. The graphical model allows us to effectively perform probabilistic predictions and produce uncertainty estimates without imputing those missing values. We develop efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for model inference and test the proposed BTF framework on several real-world spatiotemporal data sets for both missing data imputation and short-term/long-term rolling prediction tasks. The numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed BTF approaches over many state-of-the-art techniques.},

To achieve that, we mimic human capability of envisioning new concepts from prior knowledge, and propose a novel task-adaptive negative class envision method (TANE) to model the open world. Essentially we use an external memory to estimate a negative class representation. Moreover, we introduce a novel conjugate episode training strategy that strengthens the learning process. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance on few-shot open-set recognition. Besides, we extend our method to generalized few-shot open-set recognition (GFSOR), where we also achieve performance gains on MiniImageNet.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) suffer from a rapid decrease in performance when trained on a sequence of tasks where only data of the most recent task is available. This phenomenon, known as catastrophic forgetting, prevents DNNs from accumulating knowledge over time. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting and enabling continual learning is of great interest since it would enable the application of DNNs in settings where unrestricted access to all the training data at any time is not always possible, e.g. due to storage limitations or legal issues. While many recently proposed methods for continual learning use some training examples for rehearsal, their performance strongly depends on the number of stored examples. In order to improve performance of rehearsal for continual learning, especially for a small number of stored examples, we propose a novel way of learning a small set of synthetic examples which capture the essence of a complete dataset. Instead of directly learning these synthetic examples, we learn a weighted combination of shared components for each example that enables a significant increase in memory efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of our method on commonly used datasets and compare it to recently proposed related methods and baselines.},

In these methods it is important to be able to determine horizontal seismic accelerations independent of tilts of the ground. Measurement of changes in inclination of the suspension wire of a test mass, relative to a direction defined by a reference arm of long period of oscillation, makes it possible to carry this out over the frequency range of interest for earth-based gravitational radiation detectors. The signal obtained can then be used to compensate for the effects of seismic disturbances on the test mass if necessary. Alternatively the signal corresponding to horizontal acceleration can be used to move the point from which the test mass is suspended in such a way as to reduce the effect of the seismic disturbance and also damp pendulum motions of the suspended test mass.

From an augmented view of an image, BYOL trains an online network to predict a target network representation of a different augmented view of the same image. Unlike contrastive methods, BYOL does not explicitly use a repulsion term built from negative pairs in its training objective. Yet, it avoids collapse to a trivial, constant representation. Thus, it has recently been hypothesized that batch normalization (BN) is critical to prevent collapse in BYOL. Indeed, BN flows gradients across batch elements, and could leak information about negative views in the batch, which could act as an implicit negative (contrastive) term. However, we experimentally show that replacing BN with a batch-independent normalization scheme (namely, a combination of group normalization and weight standardization) achieves performance comparable to vanilla BYOL ($73.9\%$ vs. $74.3\%$ top-1 accuracy under the linear evaluation protocol on ImageNet with ResNet-$50$). Our finding disproves the hypothesis that the use of batch statistics is a crucial ingredient for BYOL to learn useful representations.},

abstract = {Given an input feature vector f â F â R n , the neu-ral gas (NG) net matches it to the node j whose centroid m j â R n has the minimum distance d(f , m j) to f. In our implementation, we simply use the Euclidean distance as the distance measure, which is written in the following L 2 norm form: d(f , m j) = f â m j 2. To train a NG net of N nodes on the base class data, we first extract the feature set F (1) from D (1). We initialize NG net by randomly selecting N feature vectors from F (1) as the initial centroid vectors of N nodes. The number of nodes is determined according to diversity of F (1). We ensure the number of NG nodes is larger than the number of classes, so that each class has at least one node for correspondence. Heuristically, we set N = 400 for all datasets. Each node is adapted to f using Eq. (3) in the main paper. For node r i whose rank is i, the contribution by the input vector f is measured using the decay function e âi/$\alpha$. That is, if node r i has a large rank i $\alpha$, its distance with the input d(f , m ri) is very large, and we neglect the adaptation to speed up the training. For this purpose, we can set $\alpha$ to a smaller value (e.g. $\alpha$ = 10 in our experiments.) This can reduce the time complexity of "sorting" from O(N log 2 N) to O(log 2 N). The topology-preserving mechanism is achieved by the competitive Hebbian learning, where a topological connection between node i and j is established and maintained, if the two nodes are always simultaneously response to the input (i.e., the nearest and second nearest to the input). The "age" of the connection a ij is used to record how long the two nodes have not been activated simultaneously. If a ij > T , the connection is removed. We set T = 200 for training on the base class data according to [8]. Noting that * Corresponding author if the number of training iterations is smaller, the value of T should be decreased to a smaller value, correspondingly.},

abstract = {Object Detection has been a significant topic in computer vision. As the continuous development of Deep Learning, many advanced academic and industrial outcomes are established on localising and classifying the target objects, such as instance segmentation, video tracking and robotic vision. As the core concept of Deep Learning, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and associated training are highly integrated with task-driven modelling, having great effects on accurate detection. The main focus of improving detection performance is proposing DNNs with extra layers and novel topological connections to extract the desired features from input data. However, training these models can be computationally expensive and laborious progress as the complicated model architecture and enormous parameters. Besides, the dataset is another reason causing this issue and low detection accuracy, because of insufficient data samples or difficult instances. To address these training difficulties, this thesis presents two different approaches to improve the detection performance in the relatively light-weight way. As the intrinsic feature of data-driven in deep learning, the first approach is "slot-based image augmentation" to enrich the dataset with extra foreground and background combinations. Instead of the commonly used image flipping method, the proposed system achieved similar mAP improvement with less extra images which decrease training time. This proposed augmentation system has extra flexibility adapting to various scenarios and the performance-driven analysis provides an alternative aspect of conducting image augmentation},

abstract = {In this master's thesis, wind speeds and directions were modeled with the aim of developing suitable models for hourly, daily, weekly and monthly forecasting. Artificial Neural Networks implemented in MATLAB software were used to perform the forecasts. Three main types of artificial neural network were built, namely: Feed forward neural networks, Jordan Elman neural networks and Cascade forward neural networks. Four sub models of each of these neural networks were also built, corresponding to the four forecast horizons, for both wind speeds and directions. A single neural network topology was used for each of the forecast horizons, regardless of the model type. All the models were then trained with real data of wind speeds and directions collected over a period of two years in the municipal region of Puumala in Finland. Only 70% of the data was used for training, validation and testing of the models, while the second last 15% of the data was presented to the trained models for verification. The model outputs were then compared to the last 15% of the original data, by measuring the mean square errors and sum square errors between them. Based on the results, the feed forward networks returned the lowest generalization errors for hourly, weekly and monthly forecasts of wind speeds; Jordan Elman networks returned the lowest errors when used for forecasting of daily wind speeds. Cascade forward networks gave the lowest errors when used for forecasting daily, weekly and monthly wind directions; Jordan Elman networks returned the lowest errors when used for hourly forecasting. The errors were relatively low during training of the models, but shot up upon simulation with new inputs. In addition, a combination of hyperbolic tangent transfer functions for both hidden and output layers returned better results compared to other combinations of transfer functions. In general, wind speeds were more predictable as compared to wind directions, opening up opportunities for further research into building better models for wind direction forecasting.},

In this context, the aim of this study was the development and validation of models using fuzzy logic for predicting climate indices and productive performance of European quails kept in a climatic chamber. The model developed was analyzed from two points of view; the first one took into account the prediction of climate indexes where the input variables were the temperature (Â°C) and relative humidity (%) of the air. In the second, related to the prediction of productive performance, the input variables were air temperature (Â°C) and age of the birds (weeks) while the output variables were the food intake (FI, g), water consumption (WC, g), weight gain (WG, g) and food conversion (FC g g-1) of the birds. The Mamdani method was used for the preparation of the rules, and in the defuzzification was applied the center of gravity method. Based on the results generated by the models and compared with the experimental data it was obtained coefficients of determination (R1) of: 0.9771; 0.9897; 0.9955; 0.9995; 0.9993 and 0.9788, for BGTHI, RTL, WC, FI, WG and FC, respectively.},

Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules.},

The second model is support vector regression with a radial basis function (SVR-RBF). The third model is adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that is optimized with a partial swarm optimization algorithm (ANFIS-PSO). Temperature, pressure, relative humidity and local time are considered as input variables of the models. A large set of wind speed and wind direction data measured at 5-min, 10-min, 30-min and 1-h intervals are utilized to accurately predict wind speed and its direction for Bushehr. Energy and exergy analysis of wind energy for a wind turbine (E-44, 900 kW) is done. Also, the developed models are used to predict the output power of the wind turbine. Comparison of the statistical indices for the predicted and actual data indicate that the SVR-RBF model outperforms the MLFFNN and ANFIS-PSO models. Also, the current energy and exergy analysis presents an average of 32% energy efficiency and approximately 25% exergy efficiency of the wind turbine in the study region.},

abstract = {Active learning aims to develop label-efficient algorithms by querying the most representative samples to be labeled by a human annotator. Current active learning techniques either rely on model uncertainty to select the most uncertain samples or use clustering or reconstruction to choose the most diverse set of unlabeled examples. While uncertainty-based strategies are susceptible to outliers, solely relying on sample diversity does not capture the information available on the main task. In this work, we develop a semi-supervised minimax entropy-based active learning algorithm that leverages both uncertainty and diversity in an adversarial manner. Our model consists of an entropy minimizing feature encoding network followed by an entropy maximizing classification layer. This minimax formulation reduces the distribution gap between the labeled/unlabeled data, while a discriminator is simultaneously trained to distinguish the labeled/unlabeled data. The highest entropy samples from the classifier that the discriminator predicts as unlabeled are selected for labeling. We extensively evaluate our method on various image classification and semantic segmentation benchmark datasets and show superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance in various applications. In the real world, network data is usually formed in a streaming fashion. The distributions of patterns that refer to neighborhood information of nodes may shift over time. The GNN model needs to learn the new patterns that cannot yet be captured. But learning incrementally leads to the catastrophic forgetting problem that historical knowledge is overwritten by newly learned knowledge. Therefore, it is important to train GNN model to learn new patterns and maintain existing patterns simultaneously, which few works focus on. In this paper, we propose a streaming GNN model based on continual learning so that the model is trained incrementally and up-to-date node representations can be obtained at each time step. Firstly, we design an approximation algorithm to detect new coming patterns efficiently based on information propagation. Secondly, we combine two perspectives of data replaying and model regularization for existing pattern consolidation. Specially, a hierarchy-importance sampling strategy for nodes is designed and a weighted regularization term for GNN parameters is derived, achieving greater stability and generalization of knowledge consolidation. Our model is evaluated on real and synthetic data sets and compared with multiple baselines. The results of node classification prove that our model can efficiently update model parameters and achieve comparable performance to model retraining. In addition, we also conduct a case study on the synthetic data, and carry out some specific analysis for each part of our model, illustrating its ability to learn new knowledge and maintain existing knowledge from different perspectives.},

abstract = {To harness renewable energy in the transportation sector,research on the application of thermoelectric and piezoelectric effects in energy harvesting pavements has progressed significantly over the last few years. This study provides a comprehensive literature review of recent advances in the application of thermoelectric and piezoelectric technologies in pavements to generate electricity. Most studies on the piezoelectric effect application with piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) showed its limitation in the amount of instantaneous electricity output, while a limited number of studies indicated that a pipe system cooperating with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) may produce more electric power, and so has more application potential in energy harvesting pavements. Studies have also indicated that supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries will be needed to appropriately store the electricity generated from pavements. As a case study, the potentials of thermoelectric and piezoelectric technologies were assessed and compared based on the Florida roadway network. Using results from previous studies as well as Florida weather and traffic data, it was estimated that if the entire Florida roadway network was covered by a proposed pipe system (PP-TEG system), it would collect 55 GWh electrical energy per day, while the one covered by a series of PZTs (PZT system) would only generate 4.04 MWh electrical energy per day. Based on the cost effectiveness analysis of the two systems, unless the PZT system is only paved on the roadway section with very high traffic volume, the PP-TEG system is more cost-effective than the PZT system.},

abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Trans-ferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

Near infrared (NIR probe) with or without a tumor-targeting warhead have been considered and discussed for their applications in the field of cancer imaging. In addition, challenges persist in this area are also delineated in this review.},

abstract = {We present an unsupervised representation learning approach using videos without semantic labels. We leverage the temporal coherence as a supervisory signal by formulating representation learning as a sequence sorting task. We take temporally shuffled frames (i.e., in non-chronological order) as inputs and train a convolutional neural network to sort the shuffled sequences. Similar to comparison-based sorting algorithms, we propose to extract features from all frame pairs and aggregate them to predict the correct order. As sorting shuffled image sequence requires an understanding of the statistical temporal structure of images, training with such a proxy task allows us to learn rich and generalizable visual representation. We validate the effectiveness of the learned representation using our method as pre-training on high-level recognition problems. The experimental results show that our method compares favorably against state-of-the-art methods on action recognition, image classification, and object detection tasks.},

abstract = {Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet).

For deep learning, even though we can access all neurons' activity data, interpretation of how the deep network solves the task is still challenging. Although a large amount of effort has been devoted to interpreting a deep network, there is still no consensus of what interpretation is. This paper tries to push the discussion in this direction and proposes an information-theoretic progressive framework to synthesize interpretation. Firstly, we discuss intuitions of interpretation: interpretation is meta-information; interpretation should be at the right level; inducing independence is helpful to interpretation; interpretation is naturally progressive; interpretation doesn't have to involve a human. Then, we build the framework with an information map splitting idea and implement it with the variational information bottleneck technique. After that, we test the framework with the CLEVR dataset. The framework is shown to be able to split information maps and synthesize interpretation in the form of meta-information.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

The consequent parameters of the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system in both the hybrid algorithms are tuned using Kalman filter. Whereas the antecedent parameters of the system in the first hybrid algorithm is optimized using the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and using the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) in the second hybrid algorithm. Root mean square error and maximum absolute error as the two accuracy objective are utilized to find the Pareto-optimal solution with the MOPSO and MOEA/D respectively. The proposed hybrid multi-objective designs of the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system are utilized to the prediction of solar photovoltaic output. It is observed that MOEA/D outperforms MOPSO in this case in terms of quality of results and its diversity. Finally, one point is selected from the obtained Pareto front and its performance is illustrated.},

These patterns are then utilized by different distribution fitting methods to obtain statistical prediction intervals which can express the expected accuracy of the NWP system output. Three years of weather forecast records in two weather stations are used in a set of experiments to empirically study the application of the proposed approach. Skills of the probabilistic forecasts obtained by these post-processing methods are investigated by considering cross fold validation and sampling variations.

However, most recent progress hinges on heuristic approaches with limited understanding of attention's role in model optimization and computation, and rely on considerable memory and computational resources that scale poorly. In this work, we present a formal analysis of how self-attention affects gradient propagation in recurrent networks, and prove that it mitigates the problem of vanishing gradients when trying to capture long-term dependencies. Building on these results, we propose a relevancy screening mechanism, inspired by the cognitive process of memory consolidation, that allows for a scalable use of sparse self-attention with recurrence. While providing guarantees to avoid vanishing gradients, we use simple numerical experiments to demonstrate the tradeoffs in performance and computational resources by efficiently balancing attention and recurrence. Based on our results, we propose a concrete direction of research to improve scalability of attentive networks.},

abstract = {Do visual tasks have relationships, or are they unrelated? For instance, could having surface normals simplify estimating the depth of an image? Intuition answers these questions positively, implying existence of a certain structure among visual tasks. Understanding this structure has notable values: it provides a principled way for identifying relationships across tasks, for instance, in order to reuse supervision among redundant tasks or solve many tasks in one system without piling up the complexity. We propose a fully computational approach for identifying the transfer learning structure of the space of visual tasks. This is done via computing the transfer learning dependencies across tasks in a dictionary of twenty-six 2D, 2.5D, 3D, and semantic tasks. The product is a computational taxonomic map among tasks for transfer learning, and we exploit it to reduce the demand for labeled data. For example, we show that the total number of labeled datapoints needed for solving a set of 10 tasks can be reduced by roughly 32 (compared to training independently) while keeping the performance nearly the same. We provide a set of tools for computing and visualizing this taxonomical structure at http://taskonomy.vision.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) often suffer from "catastrophic forgetting" during incremental learning (IL) --- an abrupt degradation of performance on the original set of classes when the training objective is adapted to a newly added set of classes. Existing IL approaches tend to produce a model that is biased towards either the old classes or new classes, unless with the help of exemplars of the old data. To address this issue, we propose a class-incremental learning paradigm called Deep Model Consolidation (DMC), which works well even when the original training data is not available. The idea is to first train a separate model only for the new classes, and then combine the two individual models trained on data of two distinct set of classes (old classes and new classes) via a novel double distillation training objective. The two existing models are consolidated by exploiting publicly available unlabeled auxiliary data. This overcomes the potential difficulties due to the unavailability of original training data. Compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, DMC demonstrates significantly better performance in image classification (CIFAR-100 and CUB-200) and object detection (PASCAL VOC 2007) in the single-headed IL setting.},

We cast contrastive learning as training a non-parametric classifier by assigning a unique virtual class to each data in a batch. Then, data instances are mixed in both the input and virtual label spaces, providing more augmented data during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that i-Mix consistently improves the quality of self-supervised representations across domains, resulting in significant performance gains on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we confirm its regularization effect via extensive ablation studies across model and dataset sizes.},

abstract = {Continual learning of deep neural networks is a key requirement for scaling them up to more complex applicative scenarios and for achieving real lifelong learning of these architectures. Previous approaches to the problem have considered either the progressive increase in the size of the networks, or have tried to regularize the network behavior to equalize it with respect to previously observed tasks. In the latter case, it is essential to understand what type of information best represents this past behavior. Common techniques include regularizing the past outputs, gradients, or individual weights. In this work, we propose a new, relatively simple and efficient method to perform continual learning by regularizing instead the network internal embeddings. To make the approach scalable, we also propose a dynamic sampling strategy to reduce the memory footprint of the required external storage. We show that our method performs favorably with respect to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, while requiring significantly less space in memory and computational time. In addition, inspired by to recent works, we evaluate the impact of selecting a more flexible model for the activation functions inside the network, evaluating the impact of catastrophic forgetting on the activation functions themselves.},

However, for some real-world applications, it is too expensive to collect the task-specific labels, such as visual search in online shopping. Compared to the limited availability of these task-specific labels, their coarse-class labels are much more affordable, but representations learned from them can be suboptimal for the target task. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an algorithm to learn the fine-grained patterns for the target task, when only its coarse-class labels are available. More importantly, we provide a theoretical guarantee for this. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of learned representations on the target task, when only coarse-class information is available for training.

For a first given experience, an initial Variational Autoencoder, together with a set of fully connected neural networks are utilized to respectively learn the appearance of video frames and their dynamics at the latent space level. By employing an adapted Markov Jump Particle Filter, the proposed method recognizes new situations and integrates them as predictive models avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. For evaluating the proposed method, this article uses video sequences from a vehicle that performs different tasks in a controlled environment.},

@article{Bahng2019a,
abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated by splitting data from a single source into training and test sets. While such focus on in-distribution learning scenarios has led interesting advances, it has not been able to tell if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for successful prediction (e.g., using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles). Such biased models fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a different class. The cross-bias generalisation problem has been addressed by de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of a snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a de-biased representation by encouraging it to be different from a set of representations that are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many scenarios where it is much easier to define a set of biased representations than to define and quantify bias. Our experiments and analyses show that our method discourages models from taking bias shortcuts, resulting in improved performances on de-biased test data.},

@article{Iscen2020,
abstract = {In this work we introduce an approach for incremental learning, which preserves feature descriptors instead of images unlike most existing work. Keeping such low-dimensional embeddings instead of images reduces the memory footprint significantly. We assume that the model is updated incrementally for new classes as new data becomes available sequentially. This requires adapting the previously stored feature vectors to the updated feature space without having access to the corresponding images. Feature adaptation is learned with a multi-layer perceptron, which is trained on feature pairs of an image corresponding to the outputs of the original and updated network. We validate experimentally that such a transformation generalizes well to the features of the previous set of classes, and maps features to a discriminative subspace in the feature space. As a result, the classifier is optimized jointly over new and old classes without requiring old class images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy in incremental learning benchmarks, while having at least an order of magnitude lower memory footprint compared to image preserving strategies.},

This environment-friendly catalyst is thermally activated at 800 Â°C for 3 h. The resulting CaO catalyst was characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed desorption of CO2(TPD-CO2), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD patterns of calcined catalyst showed intense peaks of calcium oxide, consistent with XRF results that revealed calcium is the major element present in the obtuse horn shells. High calcination temperature (800 Â°C) tended to promote agglomeration of fine crystals, resulted in a smaller surface area (0.07 m2/g) as examined by BET. Catalytic activities in the transesterification process had been investigated using one-variable-at-a-time technique. The optimum palm oil conversion was 86.75% under reaction conditions of 6 h, 5 wt.% of catalyst amount and methanol to oil ratio of 12:1. Reusability of this waste shell derived catalyst was examined and results showed that the prepared catalysts are able to be reused up to 3 times with conversion of more than 70% after the third cycles. Although the reusability may not be excellent at the moment, it is still in the exploratory study. More efforts were done to improve its properties and stability.},

Such fractionalization is a function of technology and labour process, underpinned by adopted ideology. Alignment with social movement objectives overcomes the class belongingness of accounting that limits its progressive role in normal circumstances. We illustrate the role of accounting in achieving limitations to working hours and child labour, drawing on accounting evidence used to resist and support factory reform during the industrial revolution. We compare the evidence on costs and profits presented by both sides in parliamentary hearings and also with data revealed from the business accounts of the main protagonists. These comparisons show that assumptions about cost behaviour were used to exaggerate or mitigate the apparent effects of reduced working time on profits. Regressive fractions of capital were unable to resist change because they failed to consistently monopolize accounting information to impose a dominant narrative about the consequences of regulation.},

However, various learning methods for neural architecture have been proposed in search of more biologically plausible learning. Most of them have tried to solve the "weight transport problem" and try to propagate errors backward in the architecture via some alternative methods. In this work, we investigated a slightly different approach that uses only the local information which captures spike timing information with no propagation of errors. The proposed learning rule is derived from the concepts of spike timing dependant plasticity and neuronal association. A preliminary evaluation done on the binary classification of MNIST and IRIS datasets with two hidden layers shows comparable performance with backpropagation. The model learned using this method also shows a possibility of better adversarial robustness against the FGSM attack compared to the model learned through backpropagation of cross-entropy loss. The local nature of learning gives a possibility of large scale distributed and parallel learning in the network. And finally, the proposed method is a more biologically sound method that can probably help in understanding how biological neurons learn different abstractions.},

Special interest is paid towards wind energy because of its competitively. Savonius rotor is a vertical axis wind turbine which is characterized as cheaper, simpler in construction and low speed turbine. This makes it suitable for generating mechanical energy in many countries especially in Egypt. In this work different geometries of Savonius wind turbine are experimentally studied in order to determine the most effective operation parameters. It was found that, the two blades rotor is more efficient than three and four ones. The rotor with end plates gives higher efficiency than those of without end plates. Double stage rotors have higher performance compared to single stage rotors. The rotors without overlap ratio ($\beta$) are better in operation than those with overlap. The results show also that the power coefficient increases with rising the aspect ratio ($\alpha$). The conclusions from the measurements of the static torque for each rotor at different wind speeds verify the above summarized results of this work. {\textcopyright} 2012 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

A three-way tension exists between the allocation of computing resources to refine model resolution, the expansion of model complexity/capability, and the increase of ensemble size. Here we review evidence for the benefits of increased ocean resolution in global coupled models, where the ocean component explicitly represents transient mesoscale eddies and narrow boundary currents. We consider lessons learned from forced ocean/sea-ice simulations; from studies concerning the SST resolution required to impact atmospheric simulations; and from coupled predictions. Impacts of the mesoscale ocean in western boundary current regions on the large-scale atmospheric state have been identified. Understanding of air-sea feedback in western boundary currents is modifying our view of the dynamics in these key regions. It remains unclear whether variability associated with open ocean mesoscale eddies is equally important to the large-scale atmospheric state. We include a discussion of what processes can presently be parameterised in coupled models with coarse resolution non-eddying ocean models, and where parameterizations may fall short. We discuss the benefits of resolution and identify gaps in the current literature that leave important questions unanswered.},

The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments.

Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences.

A central theme of this task is to learn new classes that arrive in sequential phases over time while keeping the model's capability of recognizing seen classes with only limited memory for preserving seen data samples. Many regularization strategies have been proposed to mitigate the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. To understand better the essence of these regularizations, we introduce a feature-graph preservation perspective. Insights into their merits and faults motivate our weighted-Euclidean regularization for old knowledge preservation. We further propose rectified cosine normalization and show how it can work with binary cross-entropy to increase class separation for effective learning of new classes. Experimental results on both CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in reducing classification error, easing catastrophic forgetting, and encouraging evenly balanced accuracy over different classes.

@article{Tosun2017,
abstract = {Ultrasonic level sensors are commonly used to measure the motion of the free surface in fluid sloshing. They are used to measure the elevation of the free surface at a single point. The sloshing forces are generally measured with load sensors, which require two sets of measurements, with and without the fluid in the tank. This paper develops a method, which tracks the free surface motion during sloshing with a camera and uses the captured images to estimate the forces due to sloshing in a rectangular tank. One of the major assumptions is that the displacement input which causes sloshing is one dimensional and the resulting sloshing motion is two dimensional. For the method to correctly estimate the sloshing forces along the displacement input direction, sloshing should be around the resonant sloshing frequency. This new method can track the motion of the complete free surface rather than a single point. It estimates the sloshing forces using image processing and potential flow theory, without the need for a load cell measurement. Free surface shapes and sloshing force estimates obtained by image processing are compared with those measured by the sensors. Good agreement is observed for low amplitude sloshing around fundamental resonance frequency.},

abstract = {In this master's thesis, wind speeds and directions were modeled with the aim of developing suitable models for hourly, daily, weekly and monthly forecasting. Artificial Neural Networks implemented in MATLAB software were used to perform the forecasts. Three main types of artificial neural network were built, namely: Feed forward neural networks, Jordan Elman neural networks and Cascade forward neural networks. Four sub models of each of these neural networks were also built, corresponding to the four forecast horizons, for both wind speeds and directions. A single neural network topology was used for each of the forecast horizons, regardless of the model type. All the models were then trained with real data of wind speeds and directions collected over a period of two years in the municipal region of Puumala in Finland. Only 70% of the data was used for training, validation and testing of the models, while the second last 15% of the data was presented to the trained models for verification. The model outputs were then compared to the last 15% of the original data, by measuring the mean square errors and sum square errors between them. Based on the results, the feed forward networks returned the lowest generalization errors for hourly, weekly and monthly forecasts of wind speeds; Jordan Elman networks returned the lowest errors when used for forecasting of daily wind speeds. Cascade forward networks gave the lowest errors when used for forecasting daily, weekly and monthly wind directions; Jordan Elman networks returned the lowest errors when used for hourly forecasting. The errors were relatively low during training of the models, but shot up upon simulation with new inputs. In addition, a combination of hyperbolic tangent transfer functions for both hidden and output layers returned better results compared to other combinations of transfer functions. In general, wind speeds were more predictable as compared to wind directions, opening up opportunities for further research into building better models for wind direction forecasting.},

However, all of these approaches rely on access to the original training set, which might not always be possible if the network to be compressed was trained on a very large dataset, or on a dataset whose release poses privacy or safety concerns as may be the case for biometrics tasks. We present a method for data-free knowledge distillation, which is able to compress deep neural networks trained on large-scale datasets to a fraction of their size leveraging only some extra metadata to be provided with a pretrained model release. We also explore different kinds of metadata that can be used with our method, and discuss tradeoffs involved in using each of them.},

abstract = {We identify and formalize a fundamental gradient descent phenomenon resulting in a learning proclivity in over-parameterized neural networks. Gradient Starvation arises when cross-entropy loss is minimized by capturing only a subset of features relevant for the task, despite the presence of other predictive features that fail to be discovered. This work provides a theoretical explanation for the emergence of such feature imbalance in neural networks. Using tools from Dynamical Systems theory, we identify simple properties of learning dynamics during gradient descent that lead to this imbalance, and prove that such a situation can be expected given certain statistical structure in training data. Based on our proposed formalism, we develop guarantees for a novel regularization method aimed at decoupling feature learning dynamics, improving accuracy and robustness in cases hindered by gradient starvation. We illustrate our findings with simple and real-world out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization experiments.},

During this time, the evolution of relevant technologies for UAVs; such as component miniaturization, the increase of computational capabilities, and the evolution of computer vision techniques have allowed an important advance in the development of UAVs technologies and applications. Particularly, computer vision technologies integrated in UAVs allow to develop cutting-edge technologies to cope with aerial perception difficulties; such as visual navigation algorithms, obstacle detection and avoidance and aerial decision-making. All these expert technologies have developed a wide spectrum of application for UAVs, beyond the classic military and defense purposes. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Computer Vision are common topics in expert systems, so thanks to the recent advances in perception technologies, modern intelligent applications are developed to enhance autonomous UAV positioning, or automatic algorithms to avoid aerial collisions, among others. Then, the presented survey is based on artificial perception applications that represent important advances in the latest years in the expert system field related to the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. In this paper, the most significant advances in this field are presented, able to solve fundamental technical limitations; such as visual odometry, obstacle detection, mapping and localization, et cetera. Besides, they have been analyzed based on their capabilities and potential utility. Moreover, the applications and UAVs are divided and categorized according to different criteria.},

On robustness test sets, it improves ImageNet-A top-1 accuracy from 16.6% to 74.2%, reduces ImageNet-C mean corruption error from 45.7 to 31.2, and reduces ImageNet-P mean flip rate from 27.8 to 16.1. To achieve this result, we first train an EfficientNet model on labeled ImageNet images and use it as a teacher to generate pseudo labels on 300M unlabeled images. We then train a larger EfficientNet as a student model on the combination of labeled and pseudo labeled images. We iterate this process by putting back the student as the teacher. During the generation of the pseudo labels, the teacher is not noised so that the pseudo labels are as good as possible. But during the learning of the student, we inject noise such as data augmentation, dropout, stochastic depth to the student so that the noised student is forced to learn harder from the pseudo labels.},

In particular, we derive the computational properties which CL algorithms would have to possess in order to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our main finding is that such optimal CL algorithms generally solve an NP-hard problem and will require perfect memory to do so. The findings are of theoretical interest, but also explain the excellent performance of CL algorithms using experience replay, episodic memory and core sets relative to regularization-based approaches.},

abstract = {Transfer learning is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet little work has been done to evaluate the relationship between architecture and transfer. An implicit hypothesis in modern computer vision research is that models that perform better on ImageNet necessarily perform better on other vision tasks. However, this hypothesis has never been systematically tested. Here, we compare the performance of 16 classification networks on 12 image classification datasets. We find that, when networks are used as fixed feature extractors or fine-tuned, there is a strong correlation between ImageNet accuracy and transfer accuracy (r = 0.99 and 0.96, respectively). In the former setting, we find that this relationship is very sensitive to the way in which networks are trained on ImageNet; many common forms of regularization slightly improve ImageNet accuracy but yield features that are much worse for transfer learning. Additionally, we find that, on two small fine-grained image classification datasets, pretraining on ImageNet provides minimal benefits, indicating the learned features from ImageNet do not transfer well to fine-grained tasks. Together, our results show that ImageNet architectures generalize well across datasets, but ImageNet features are less general than previously suggested.},

abstract = {The recent advanced face recognition systems were built on large Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or their ensembles, which have millions of parameters. However, the expensive computation of DNNs make their deployment difficult on mobile and embedded devices. This work addresses model compression for face recognition, where the learned knowledge of a large teacher network or its ensemble is utilized as supervision to train a compact student network. Unlike previous works that represent the knowledge by the soften label probabilities, which are difficult to fit, we represent the knowledge by using the neurons at the higher hidden layer, which preserve as much information as the label probabilities, but are more compact. By leveraging the essential characteristics (domain knowledge) of the learned face representation, a neuron selection method is proposed to choose neurons that are most relevant to face recognition. Using the selected neurons as supervision to mimic the single networks of DeepID2+ and DeepID3, which are the state-of-The-Art face recognition systems, a compact student with simple network structure achieves better verification accuracy on LFW than its teachers, respectively. When using an ensemble of DeepID2+ as teacher, a mimicked student is able to outperform it and achieves 51.6 Ã compression ratio and 90 Ã speed-up in inference, making this cumbersome model applicable on portable devices.},

In randomized early phase proof-of-concept studies, focusing on lifestyle intervention, there is evidence that mHealth technology can improve outcomes. By contrast, results from small randomized controlled trials that tested mHealth interventions in heart failure patients were disappointing with inconsistent findings. These inconclusive results could be partially attributed to a lack of methodological rigor (insufficient sample size, quasi-experimental design, inadequate mHealth equipment). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop systematic evidence-based guidelines and parameters for mHealth to be effectively utilized in cardiovascular clinical trials.},

abstract = {In a seminal paper, Lin and Reiter introduced a model-theoretic definition for the progression of a basic action theory in the situation calculus, and proved that it implies the intended properties. They also showed that this definition comes with a strong negative result, namely that for certain cases first-order logic is not expressive enough to correctly characterize the progressed theory and second-order axioms are necessary. However, they also considered an alternative simpler definition according to which the progressed theory is always first-order definable. They conjectured that this alternative definition is incorrect in the sense that the progressed theory is too weak and may sometimes lose information. This conjecture and the status of the definability of progression in first-order logic has remained open since. In this paper we present two significant results about this alternative definition of progression. First, we prove the Lin and Reiter conjecture by presenting a case where the progressed theory indeed does lose information, thus closing a question that has remained open for more than ten years. Second, we prove that the alternative definition is nonetheless correct for reasoning about a large class of sentences, including some that quantify over situations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel single-task continual learning framework named Bi-Objective Continual Learning (BOCL). BOCL aims at both consolidating historical knowledge and learning from new data. On one hand, we propose to preserve the old knowledge using a small set of pillars, and develop the pillar consolidation (PLC) loss to preserve the old knowledge and to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem. On the other hand, we develop the contrastive pillar (CPL) loss term to improve the classification performance, and examine several data sampling strategies for efficient onsite learning from ânew' with a reasonable amount of computational resources. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR10/100, CORe50 and a subset of ImageNet validate the BOCL framework. We also reveal the performance accuracy of different sampling strategies when used to finetune a given CNN model. The code will be released.},

abstract = {Background: The wider background to this article is the shift in the energy paradigm from fossil energy sources to renewable sources which should occur in the twenty-first century. This transformation requires the development of alternative energy technologies that enable the deployment of renewable energy sources in transportation, heating, and electricity. Among others, hydrogen and fuel cell technologies have the potential to fulfill this requirement and to contribute to a sustainable and emission-free transport and energy system. However, whether they will ever reach broad societal acceptance will not only depend on technical issues alone. The aim of our study is to reveal the importance of nontechnical issues. Therefore, the article at hand presents a case study of hydrogen and fuel cells in Germany and aims at highlighting the cultural context that affects their development. Methods: Our results were obtained from a rich pool of data generated in various research projects through more than 30 in-depth interviews, direct observations, and document analyses. Results: We found that individual and collective actors developed five specific supportive practices which they deploy in five diverse arenas of meaning in order to attach certain values to hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. Conclusions: Based on the results, we drew more general conclusions and deducted an overall model for the analysis of culture in technological innovations that is outlined at the end of the article. It constitutes our contribution to the interdisciplinary collaboration required for tackling the shift in this energy paradigm.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Optimizing most structural systems used in practice requires considering design variables as discrete quantities. The paper presents a simple genetic algorithm for optimizing structural systems with discrete design variables. As genetic algorithms (GAs) are best suited for unconstrained optimization problems, it is necessary to transform the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. A penalty-based transformation method is used in the present work. The penalty parameter depends on the degree of constraint violation, which is found to be wellsuited for a parallel search using genetic algorithms. The concept of optimization using the genetic algorithm is presented in detail using a three-bar truss problem. All the computations for three successive generations are presented in the form of tables for easy understanding of the algorithm. Two standard problems from literature are solved and results compared. The application of the genetic algorithm to design optimization of a larger problem is illustrated using a 160-bar transmission tower},

abstract = {The ability of artificial agents to increment their capabilities when confronted with new data is an open challenge in artificial intelligence. The main challenge faced in such cases is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., the tendency of neural networks to underfit past data when new ones are ingested. A first group of approaches tackles forgetting by increasing deep model capacity to accommodate new knowledge. A second type of approaches fix the deep model size and introduce a mechanism whose objective is to ensure a good compromise between stability and plasticity of the model. While the first type of algorithms were compared thoroughly, this is not the case for methods which exploit a fixed size model. Here, we focus on the latter, place them in a common conceptual and experimental framework and propose the following contributions: (1) define six desirable properties of incremental learning algorithms and analyze them according to these properties, (2) introduce a unified formalization of the class-incremental learning problem, (3) propose a common evaluation framework which is more thorough than existing ones in terms of number of datasets, size of datasets, size of bounded memory and number of incremental states, (4) investigate the usefulness of herding for past exemplars selection, (5) provide experimental evidence that it is possible to obtain competitive performance without the use of knowledge distillation to tackle catastrophic forgetting and (6) facilitate reproducibility by integrating all tested methods in a common open-source repository. The main experimental finding is that none of the existing algorithms achieves the best results in all evaluated settings. Important differences arise notably if a bounded memory of past classes is allowed or not.},

In this work, 2D tungsten disulfide (WS2) based saturable absorber (SA) for ultrafast photonic applications was demonstrated. WS2 nanosheets were prepared using liquid-phase exfoliation method and embedded in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) thin film for the practical usage. Saturable absorption was discovered in the WS2-PVA SA at the telecommunication wavelength near 1550 nm. By incorporating WS2-PVA SA into a fiber laser cavity, both stable mode locking operation and Q-switching operation were achieved. In the mode locking operation, the laser obtained femtosecond output pulse width and high spectral purity in the radio frequency spectrum. In the Q-switching operation, the laser had tunable repetition rate and output pulse energy of a few tens of nano joule. Our findings suggest that few-layer WS2 nanosheets embedded in PVA thin film are promising nonlinear optical materials for ultrafast photonic applications as a mode locker or Q-switcher.

abstract = {Detection identifies objects as axis-aligned boxes in an image. Most successful object detectors enumerate a nearly exhaustive list of potential object locations and classify each. This is wasteful, inefficient, and requires additional post-processing. In this paper, we take a different approach. We model an object as a single point --- the center point of its bounding box. Our detector uses keypoint estimation to find center points and regresses to all other object properties, such as size, 3D location, orientation, and even pose. Our center point based approach, CenterNet, is end-to-end differentiable, simpler, faster, and more accurate than corresponding bounding box based detectors. CenterNet achieves the best speed-accuracy trade-off on the MS COCO dataset, with 28.1% AP at 142 FPS, 37.4% AP at 52 FPS, and 45.1% AP with multi-scale testing at 1.4 FPS. We use the same approach to estimate 3D bounding box in the KITTI benchmark and human pose on the COCO keypoint dataset. Our method performs competitively with sophisticated multi-stage methods and runs in real-time.},

abstract = {One of the key differences between the learning mechanism of humans and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is the ability of humans to learn one task at a time. ANNs, on the other hand, can only learn multiple tasks simultaneously. Any attempts at learning new tasks incrementally cause them to completely forget about previous tasks. This lack of ability to learn incrementally, called Catastrophic Forgetting, is considered a major hurdle in building a true AI system. In this paper, our goal is to isolate the truly effective existing ideas for incremental learning from those that only work under certain conditions. To this end, we first thoroughly analyze the current state of the art (iCaRL) method for incremental learning and demonstrate that the good performance of the system is not because of the reasons presented in the existing literature. We conclude that the success of iCaRL is primarily due to knowledge distillation and recognize a key limitation of knowledge distillation, i.e., it often leads to bias in classifiers. Finally, we propose a dynamic threshold moving algorithm that is able to successfully remove this bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on CIFAR100 and MNIST datasets showing near-optimal results.

abstract = {Electricity demand forecasting, as a vital tool in the electricity market, plays a critical role in power utilities, which can not only reduce production costs but also save energy resources, thus making the forecasting techniques become an indispensable part of the energy system. A novel combined forecasting method based on Back Propagation (BP) neural network, Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Difference Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (diff-SARIMA) are presented in this paper. Firstly, the combined method uses all the three methods (BP, ANFIS, diff-SARIMA) to forecast respectively, and the three forecasting results were obtained. By multiplying optimal weight coefficients of the three forecasting results respectively and then adding them up, in the end the final forecasting results can be obtained. Among the three individual methods, BP and ANFIS had the ability to deal with the nonlinearity data, and diff-SARIMA had the ability to deal with the linearity and seasonality data. So the combined method eliminates drawbacks and incorporates in the merits of the individual methods. It has the capability to deal with the linearity, nonlinearity and seasonality data. In order to optimize weight coefficients, Differential Evolution (DE) optimization algorithm is brought into the combined method. To prove the superiority and accuracy, the capability of the combined method is verified by comparing it with the three individual methods. The forecasting results of the combined method proved to be better than all the three individual methods and the combined method was able to reduce errors and improve the accuracy between the actual values and forecasted values effectively. Using the half-hour electricity power data of the State of New South Wales in Australia, relevant experimental case studies showed that the proposed combined method performed better than the other three individual methods and had a higher accuracy.},

However, the current theoretical understanding of self-training only applies to linear models. This work provides a unified theoretical analysis of self-training with deep networks for semi-supervised learning, unsupervised domain adaptation, and unsupervised learning. At the core of our analysis is a simple but realistic âexpansionâ assumption, which states that a low-probability subset of the data must expand to a neighborhood with large probability relative to the subset. We also assume that neighborhoods of examples in different classes have minimal overlap. We prove that under these assumptions, the minimizers of population objectives based on self-training and input-consistency regularization will achieve high accuracy with respect to ground-truth labels. By using off-the-shelf generalization bounds, we immediately convert this result to sample complexity guarantees for neural nets that are polynomial in the margin and Lipschitzness. Our results help explain the empirical successes of recently proposed self-training algorithms which use input consistency regularization.},

abstract = {Studies examining memories of arousing 'real-life' events show that emotion heightens the feeling of remembering, without necessarily enhancing the objective accuracy of the memories. We measured brain activity associated with the feeling of remembering emotional and neutral photos. Subjects indicated whether recognition was accompanied by a recollection of details about the study episode ('remember') or not ('know'). 'Remember' judgments were boosted for emotional photos, but accuracy did not differ. For neutral photos, 'remember' judgments were related to enhanced activity in the parahippocampal cortex, previously related to recognition of visual details, which one might expect to supply the retrieval clues for a 'remember' judgment. In contrast, 'remember' judgments for emotional photos were associated with enhanced activity in the amygdala, suggesting that subjects rely on arousal and perceptual fluency to evaluate these memories. For the first time, we identify the neural mechanisms underlying the enhanced feeling of remembering for emotional events.},

Therefore, integrity and availability of computer networks become priorities, making it a fundamental resource to be managed. In this work, a scheme combining Genetic Algorithm and a Fuzzy Logic for network anomaly detection is discussed. The Genetic Algorithm is used to generate a Digital Signature of Network Segment using Flow Analysis, where information extracted from network flows data is used to predict the networks traffic behavior for a given time interval. Furthermore, a Fuzzy Logic scheme is applied to decide whether an instance represents an anomaly or not, differing from some approaches present in the literature. Indeed, it is proposed an expert system with the capability to monitor the network's traffic with IP flows while expected behaviors are generated in a regular time interval basis, issuing alarms when a possible problem is present. The proposed anomaly detection system exposes network problems autonomously. The results acquired from applying the proposed approach in a real network traffic flows achieve an accuracy of 96.53% and false positive rate of 0.56%. Moreover, our method succeeds in achieving higher performance compared to several other approaches.},

A downside to this approach is that each layer (or module, as multiple modules can operate in parallel) is tasked with processing the entire hidden state, rather than a particular part of the state which is most relevant for that module. Methods which only operate on a small number of input variables are an essential part of most programming languages, and they allow for improved modularity and code re-usability. Our proposed method, Neural Function Modules (NFM), aims to introduce the same structural capability into deep learning. Most of the work in the context of feed-forward networks combining top-down and bottom-up feedback is limited to classification problems. The key contribution of our work is to combine attention, sparsity, top-down and bottom-up feedback, in a flexible algorithm which, as we show, improves the results in standard classification, out-of-domain generalization, generative modeling, and learning representations in the context of reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.},

abstract = {Machine learning models are often used in practice if they achieve good generalization results on in-distribution (ID) holdout data. When employed in the wild, they should also be able to detect samples they cannot predict well. We show that current out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithms for neural networks produce unsatisfactory results in a variety of OOD detection scenarios, e.g. when OOD data consists of unseen classes or corrupted measurements. This paper studies how such "hard" OOD scenarios can benefit from adjusting the detection method after observing a batch of the test data. This transductive setting is relevant when the advantage of even a slightly delayed OOD detection outweighs the financial cost for additional tuning. We propose a novel method that uses an artificial labeling scheme for the test data and regularization to obtain ensembles of models that produce contradictory predictions only on the OOD samples in a test batch. We show via comprehensive experiments that our approach is indeed able to significantly outperform both inductive and transductive baselines on difficult OOD detection scenarios, such as unseen classes on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, severe corruptions(CIFAR-C), and strong covariate shift (ImageNet vs ObjectNet).},

During a person's lifetime, numerous distinct neuronal architectures are responsible for performing the same tasks. This indicates that biological neural networks are, to some degree, architecture agnostic. However, artificial networks rely on their fine-tuned weights and hand-crafted architectures for their remarkable performance. This contrast begs the question: Can we build artificial architecture agnostic neural networks? To ground this study we utilize sparse, binary neural networks that parallel the brain's circuits. Within this sparse, binary paradigm we sample many binary architectures to create families of architecture agnostic neural networks not trained via backpropagation. These high-performing network families share the same sparsity, distribution of binary weights, and succeed in both static and dynamic tasks. In summation, we create an architecture manifold search procedure to discover families or architecture agnostic neural networks.},

This led the present work to deal with developing the input-output relationship in squeeze casting process utilizing the neural network based forward and reverse mapping. Forward mapping is aimed to predict the casting quality (such as density, hardness and secondary dendrite arm spacing) for the known combination of casting variables (that is, squeeze pressure, pressure duration, die and pouring temperature). Conversely, attempt is also made to determine the appropriate set of casting variables for the required casting quality (that is, reverse mapping). Forward and reverse mapping tasks are carried out utilizing back propagation, recurrent and genetic algorithm tuned neural networks. Parameter study has been conducted to adjust and optimize the neural network parameters utilizing the batch mode of training. Since, batch mode of training requires huge data, the training data is generated artificially using response equations. Furthermore, neural network prediction performances are compared among themselves (reverse mapping) and with those of statistical regression models (forward mapping) with the help of test cases. The results shown all developed neural network models in both forward and reverse mappings are capable of making effective predictions. The results obtained will help the foundry personnel to automate and pr{\'{e}}cised control of squeeze casting process.},

We investigated the microbial community structure and population in developed purple MFC medium (DPMM) and MFC effluent (DPME) using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. In DPMM, dominant bacteria were Comamonas (44.6%), Rhodopseudomonas (19.5%) and Pseudomonas (17.2%). The bacterial community of DPME mainly consisted of bacteria related to Rhodopseudomonas (72.2%). Hydrogen oxidizing bacteria were identified in both purple-colored samples: Hydrogenophaga and Sphaerochaeta in the DPMM, and Arcobacter, unclassified Ignavibacteriaceae, Acinetobacter, Desulfovibrio and Wolinella in the DPME. The methanogenic community of both purple-colored samples was dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens including Methanobacterium, Methanobrevibacter and Methanocorpusculum with significantly lower numbers of Methanosarcina. These results suggeste that hydrogen is actively produced by Rhodopseudomonas that leads to the dominance of hydrogen consuming microorganisms in both purple-colored samples. The syntrophic relationship between Rhodopseudomonas and hydrogenotrophic microbes might be important for producing high power density in the acetate-fed MFC under light conditions.},

abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated by splitting data from a single source into training and test sets. While such focus on in-distribution learning scenarios has led interesting advances, it has not been able to tell if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for successful prediction (e.g., using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles). Such biased models fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a different class. The cross-bias generalisation problem has been addressed by de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of a snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a de-biased representation by encouraging it to be different from a set of representations that are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many scenarios where it is much easier to define a set of biased representations than to define and quantify bias. Our experiments and analyses show that our method discourages models from taking bias shortcuts, resulting in improved performances on de-biased test data.},

While some recent approaches to mid-IR supercontinuum generationâsuch as filamentation, multicolour four-wave-mixing and optical rectification1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8âhave successfully generated broad spectra, no process has been identified for achieving complex pulse shaping at the generation step. The adiabatic frequency converter9, 10 allows for a one-to-one transfer of spectral phase through nonlinear frequency conversion over a larger-than-octave-spanning range and with an overall linear phase transfer function. Here, we show that we can convert shaped near-infrared (near-IR) pulses to shaped, energetic, multi-octave-spanning mid-IR pulses lasting only 1.2 optical cycles, and extendable to the sub-cycle regime. We expect this capability to enable a new class of precisely controlled nonlinear interactions in the mid-IR spectral range, from nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy to strong lightâmatter interactions and single-shot remote sensing.},

Our approach uses a randomly initialized, fixed base network and for each task finds a subnetwork (supermask) that achieves good performance. If task identity is given at test time, the correct subnetwork can be retrieved with minimal memory usage. If not provided, SupSup can infer the task using gradient-based optimization to find a linear superposition of learned supermasks which minimizes the output entropy. In practice we find that a single gradient step is often sufficient to identify the correct mask, even among 2500 tasks. We also showcase two promising extensions. First, SupSup models can be trained entirely without task identity information, as they may detect when they are uncertain about new data and allocate an additional supermask for the new training distribution. Finally the entire, growing set of supermasks can be stored in a constant-sized reservoir by implicitly storing them as attractors in a fixed-sized Hopfield network.},

Twelve control parameter sets of binary encoded GA are tested to solve unconstrained building optimization problems that are coupled with EnergyPlus simulation program. The results show that population size is the most significant control parameter and that the crossover probability and mutation rate have insignificant effects on the GA performance. In general, a binary encoded GA with small population sizes can be used to solve unconstrained building optimization problems by around 250 building simulation calls. In particular, the smaller population size of about 5 individuals helps reach the optimum solution faster than larger population sizes.},

While there has been exciting progress in this direction, most of the approaches still require a few hundred tasks for meta-training, which limits the scalability of the approaches. Our main contribution is to formulate one-shot imitation learning as a symbolic planning problem along with the symbol grounding problem. This formulation disentangles the policy execution from the inter-task generalization and leads to better data efficiency. The key technical challenge is that the symbol grounding is prone to error with limited training data and leads to subsequent symbolic planning failures. We address this challenge by proposing a continuous relaxation of the discrete symbolic planner that directly plans on the probabilistic outputs of the symbol grounding model. Our continuous relaxation of the planner can still leverage the information contained in the probabilistic symbol grounding and significantly improve over the baseline planner for the one-shot imitation learning tasks without using large training data.},

abstract = {Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, such as quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a $ProbSparse$ Self-attention mechanism, which achieves $O(L \log L)$ in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose an approach without any forgetting to continual learning for the task-aware regime, where at inference the task-label is known. By using ternary masks we can upgrade a model to new tasks, reusing knowledge from previous tasks while not forgetting anything about them. Using masks prevents both catastrophic forgetting and backward transfer. We argue -- and show experimentally -- that avoiding the former largely compensates for the lack of the latter, which is rarely observed in practice. In contrast to earlier works, our masks are applied to the features (activations) of each layer instead of the weights. This considerably reduces the number of mask parameters to be added for each new task; with more than three orders of magnitude for most networks. The encoding of the ternary masks into two bits per feature creates very little overhead to the network, avoiding scalability issues. Our masks do not permit any changes to features which are used by previous tasks. As this may be too restrictive to allow learning of new tasks, we add task-specific feature normalization. This way, already learned features can adapt to the current task without changing the behavior of these features for previous tasks. Extensive experiments on several finegrained datasets and ImageNet show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art while reducing memory overhead in comparison to weight-based approaches.},

This systematic review provides the scholarly community with a current synthesis of mobile learning research across 2010â2016 in higher education settings regarding the purposes, outcomes, methodologies, subject matter domains, educational level, educational context, device types and geographical distribution of studies. Major findings include that the majority of the studies focused on the impact of mobile learning on student achievement. Language instruction was the most often researched subject matter domain. The findings reveal that 74% involved undergraduate students and 54% took place in a formal educational context. Higher education faculty are encouraged to consider the opportunity to expand their learning possibilities beyond the classroom with mobile learning.},

abstract = {Physical temperature can fundamentally affect psychological processes. Among other things, physical warmth typically fosters the motivation to affiliate. We argue that physical warmth can increase affirmative and acquiescent response behavior in psychological surveys and experiments as a result of such an affiliative motive. In Study 1, we find that participants give more biased answers in a memory test in warmer, compared to colder, environments. In Studies 2â3b, physical warmth fosters a response bias toward the affirmation of unrelated items in questionnaires. In Study 4, the effect of physical warmth on the affirmation bias is amplified when the person reading a participant's answers is a friend (stronger affiliation prime) compared to a stranger. Taken together, temperature affects general response behavior by fostering affirmation. Thereby, physical temperature has deeper psychological as well as methodological consequences than previously thought.},

abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

@article{Nwokocha2012,
abstract = {The current climate change threat by green house gas emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels has necessitated a search for alternative non-polluting, reliable, renewable and sustainable sources of energy such as solar energy and its derivatives. During anaerobic microbial metabolism of small carbohydrates, protons and electrons are generated together with carbon dioxide gas. After the electrons are donated to the anode by the microbes (or with the aid of chemical mediators), these electrons can be channelled through a circuit bearing a load to the cathode, where the atmospheric oxygen is reduced, first to its divalent ions and subsequently to water. Unlike other biomass-to-energy conversion techniques such as torrefaction and gasification, no emissions are produced and the process is carbon neutral. There is no need for expensive conversion techniques such as transesterification, thermal or catalytic cracking or catalytic liquefaction. It is also non-destructive; the energy is harvested in-situ and is guaranteed as long as feedstock is available, can be implemented using industrial waste water, can be used in desalination or remediation and has application potential in wetlands and erosion sites which are prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, reducing competition with food supply and other conventional sources of bio-energy.},

When tasks arrive sequentially, they lose performance on previously learnt tasks. This phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting is a fundamental challenge to overcome before neural networks can learn continually from incoming data. In this work, we derive inspiration from human memory to develop an architecture capable of learning continuously from sequentially incoming tasks, while averting catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, our contributions are: (i) a dual memory architecture emulating the complementary learning systems (hippocampus and the neocortex) in the human brain, (ii) memory consolidation via generative replay of past experiences, (iii) demonstrating advantages of generative replay and dual memories via experiments, and (iv) improved performance retention on challenging tasks even for low capacity models. Our architecture displays many characteristics of the mammalian memory and provides insights on the connection between sleep and learning.},

abstract = {We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.},

abstract = {Several approaches have been proposed in recent literature to alleviate the long-tail problem, mainly in object classification tasks. In this paper, we make the first large-scale study concerning the task of Long-Tail Visual Relationship Recognition (LTVRR). LTVRR aims at improving the learning of structured visual relationships that come from the long-tail (e.g., "rabbit grazing on grass"). In this setup, the subject, relation, and object classes each follow a long-tail distribution. To begin our study and make a future benchmark for the community, we introduce two LTVRR-related benchmarks, dubbed VG8K-LT and GQA-LT, built upon the widely used Visual Genome and GQA datasets. We use these benchmarks to study the performance of several state-of-the-art long-tail models on the LTVRR setup. Lastly, we propose a visiolinguistic hubless (VilHub) loss and a Mixup augmentation technique adapted to LTVRR setup, dubbed as RelMix. Both VilHub and RelMix can be easily integrated on top of existing models and despite being simple, our results show that they can remarkably improve the performance, especially on tail classes.

abstract = {Speed optimization of liner vessels has significant economic and environmental impact for reducing fuel cost and Green House Gas (GHG) emission as the shipping over maritime logistics takes more than 70% of world transportation. While slow steaming is widely used as best practices for liner shipping companies, they are also under the pressure to maintain service level agreement (SLA) with their cargo clients. Thus, deciding optimal speed that minimizes fuel consumption while maintaining SLA is managerial decision problem. Studies in the literature use theoretical fuel consumption functions in their speed optimization models but these functions have limitations due to weather conditions in voyages. This paper uses weather archive data to estimate the real fuel consumption function for speed optimization problems. In particular, Copernicus data set is used as the source of big data and data mining technique is applied to identify the impact of weather conditions based on a given voyage route. Particle swarm optimization, a metaheuristic optimization method, is applied to find Pareto optimal solutions that minimize fuel consumption and maximize SLA. The usefulness of the proposed approach is verified through the real data obtained from a liner company and real world implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Organizations are maintaining history of data for future analysis. These huge volume of database is analysed to Predict and improve the benefits and profits of the organization and also for the development. By analysing the history of data, strategic decisions can be made to improve the performance of the organizations by the top level peoples. So organizations are interested in analysing the data which will result in valuable insight. The data subjected to mining consists of inconsistent, blank or null and noisy values which have to be cleaned before mining. Usually the Techniques of Mean, Mode, and Median will be used to clean the data which are inefficient methods. Here I am representing the efficient data pre-processing which is to be carried out before actual mining process can be performed. The data from different databases, different locations and different formats are considered for pre-processing. This results in identification of reasonable patterns to improve the performance of organization. Even the Neural Networks has complex structure, consumes more learning time and difficult to understand the representation of results, it have more acceptance ability to clean impure data with more precise and accuracy in pre-processing which results in efficient data pre-processing for Data Mining. The data pre-processing includes four stages. They are cleaning the Data, Selecting the data, Data Enhancement and Data Transformation. Cleaning the data: is to fill the empty value of the data and to ignore the noisy data and to correct the inconsistencies data. Selecting the data: is choosing the appropriate data which suits for learning. Data Enhancement: is done to enhance the data quality which has been selected. Data Expression: is to transform the data after pre-processing into the form which can be accepted by the data mining algorithm based on neural network. The data mining based on neural network can only handle numerical data, so it is need to transform the sign data into numerical data. The simplest method is to establish a table with one-to-one correspondence between the sign data and the numerical data. The other more complex approach is to adopt the appropriate Hash function to generate a unique numerical data according to given string. Although there are many data types in relational database, but they all basically can be simply come down to sign data, discrete numerical data and serial numerical data. Then, the discrete numerical data can be quantified into continuous numerical data and can also be encoded into coding data which can be easily and efficiently handled by data mining algorithms.

abstract = {Transfer learning addresses the problem of how to utilize plenty of labeled data in a source domain to solve related but different problems in a target domain, even when the training and testing problems have different distributions or features. In this paper, we consider transfer learning via dimensionality reduction. To solve this problem, we learn a low-dimensional latent feature space where the distributions between the source domain data and the target domain data are the same or close to each other. Onto this latent feature space, we project the data in related domains where we can apply standard learning algorithms to train classification or regression models. Thus, the latent feature space can be treated as a bridge of transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a new dimensionality reduction method to find a latent space, which minimizes the distance between distributions of the data in different domains in a latent space. The effectiveness of our approach to transfer learning is verified by experiments in two real world applications: indoor WiFi localization and binary text classification.

abstract = {The computer vision world has been re-gaining enthusiasm in various pre-trained models, including both classical ImageNet supervised pre-training and recently emerged self-supervised pre-training such as simCLR and MoCo. Pre-trained weights often boost a wide range of downstream tasks including classification, detection, and segmentation. Latest studies suggest that the pre-training benefits from gigantic model capacity. We are hereby curious and ask: after pre-training, does a pre-trained model indeed have to stay large for its universal downstream transferability? In this paper, we examine the supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models through the lens of lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH). LTH identifies highly sparse matching subnetworks that can be trained in isolation from (nearly) scratch, to reach the full models' performance. We extend the scope of LTH to questioning whether matching subnetworks still exist in the pre-training models, that enjoy the same downstream transfer performance. Our extensive experiments convey an overall positive message: from all pre-trained weights obtained by ImageNet classification, simCLR and MoCo, we are consistently able to locate such matching subnetworks at 59.04% to 96.48% sparsity that transfer universally to multiple downstream tasks, whose performance see no degradation compared to using full pre-trained weights. Further analyses reveal that subnetworks found from different pre-training tend to yield diverse mask structures and perturbation sensitivities. We conclude that the core LTH observations remain generally relevant in the pre-training paradigm of computer vision, but more delicate discussions are needed in some cases. Codes and pre-trained models will be made available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/CV_LTH_Pre-training.},

abstract = {Humans can learn in a continuous manner. Old rarely utilized knowledge can be overwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently used knowledge is prevented from being erased. In artificial learning systems, lifelong learning so far has focused mainly on accumulating knowledge over tasks and overcoming catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we argue that, given the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to be learned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively. Inspired by neuroplasticity, we propose a novel approach for lifelong learning, coined Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). It computes the importance of the parameters of a neural network in an unsupervised and online manner. Given a new sample which is fed to the network, MAS accumulates an importance measure for each parameter of the network, based on how sensitive the predicted output function is to a change in this parameter. When learning a new task, changes to important parameters can then be penalized, effectively preventing important knowledge related to previous tasks from being overwritten. Further, we show an interesting connection between a local version of our method and Hebb's rule, which is a model for the learning process in the brain. We test our method on a sequence of object recognition tasks and on the challenging problem of learning an embedding for predicting <subject, predicate, object> triplets. We show state-of-the-art performance and, for the first time, the ability to adapt the importance of the parameters based on unlabeled data towards what the network needs (not) to forget, which may vary depending on test conditions.},

abstract = {Right invariant fuzzy quasi-orders for fuzzy automata are broadly studied in the recent literature, as they arise as solutions to particular systems of fuzzy relation equations and inequalities. Some of their applications include determinization and state reduction procedures, as well as simulations and bisimulations for fuzzy automata. In this paper we provide a procedure for computing the greatest right invariant fuzzy quasi-order for a given fuzzy automaton over a complete residuated lattice. The proposed procedure terminates in a finite number of steps whenever the underlying structure of the fuzzy automaton is locally finite. When the previous condition is not satisfied, we show that the greatest right invariant fuzzy quasi-order can be obtained by taking the limit value of the convergent array of fuzzy quasi-orders for fuzzy automata over BL-algebras on the real unit interval [0,1]. Analogous procedures for computing the greatest left invariant fuzzy quasi-order, as well as the greatest right and left invariant fuzzy equivalences for a fuzzy automaton are also presented. In addition, the faster algorithm for computing the greatest right invariant equivalence on a nondeterministic automaton is also presented.},

abstract = {Recent advances in deep representation learning on Riemannian manifolds extend classical deep learning operations to better capture the geometry of the manifold. One possible extension is the Fr\'echet mean, the generalization of the Euclidean mean; however, it has been difficult to apply because it lacks a closed form with an easily computable derivative. In this paper, we show how to differentiate through the Fr\'echet mean for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. Then, focusing on hyperbolic space, we derive explicit gradient expressions and a fast, accurate, and hyperparameter-free Fr\'echet mean solver. This fully integrates the Fr\'echet mean into the hyperbolic neural network pipeline. To demonstrate this integration, we present two case studies. First, we apply our Fr\'echet mean to the existing Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network, replacing its projected aggregation to obtain state-of-the-art results on datasets with high hyperbolicity. Second, to demonstrate the Fr\'echet mean's capacity to generalize Euclidean neural network operations, we develop a hyperbolic batch normalization method that gives an improvement parallel to the one observed in the Euclidean setting.},

abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study of bubbly flows at relatively high void fractions using an advanced image processing method. Bubble overlapping is a common problem in such flows and the past studies often treat the overlapping bubbles as a whole, which introduces considerable measurement uncertainties. In this study, a hybrid method combining intersection point detection and watershed segmentation is used to separate the overlapping bubbles. In order to reconstruct bubbles from separated segments, a systematic procedure is developed which can preserve more features captured in the raw image compared to the simple ellipse fitting method. The distributions of void fraction, interfacial area concentration, number density and velocity are obtained from the extracted bubble information. High-speed images of air-water bubbly flows are acquired and processed for eight test runs conducted in a 30Â mmÂ ÃÂ 10Â mm rectangular channel. The developed image processing scheme can effectively separate overlapping bubbles and the results compare well with the measurements by the gas flow meter and double-sensor conductivity probe. The development of flows in transverse and mainstream directions are analyzed and compared with the prediction made by the one-dimensional interfacial area transport equation (IATE) and the bubble number density transport equation.},

abstract = {How can local-search methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) avoid bad local minima in training multi-layer neural networks? Why can they fit random labels even given non-convex and non-smooth architectures? Most existing theory only covers networks with one hidden layer, so can we go deeper? In this paper, we focus on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are multi-layer networks widely used in natural language processing. They are harder to analyze than feedforward neural networks, because the same recurrent unit is repeatedly applied across the entire time horizon of length L, which is analogous to feedforward networks of depth L. We show when the number of neurons is sufficiently large, meaning polynomial in the training data size and in L, then SGD is capable of minimizing the regression loss in the linear convergence rate. This gives theoretical evidence of how RNNs can memorize data. More importantly, in this paper we build general toolkits to analyze multi-layer networks with ReLU activations. For instance, we prove why ReLU activations can prevent exponential gradient explosion or vanishing, and build a perturbation theory to analyze first-order approximation of multi-layer networks.},

The earliest theoretical developments and techniques some six decades ago can be attributed to Lev Chernov, Philip Morse, Herman Feshbach, Uno Ingard, John Wild and Jack Reid. Later, Floyd Dunn developed important views as to how connective tissue affected the interaction between ultrasound and soft tissue. Then, as the theory of wave propagation in soft tissues with random inhomogeneities was extended and applied by Fred Lizzi, Jim Zagzebski and Mike Insana (and their colleagues), contemporary QUS successes started to emerge.},

An application of the methodology is also illustrated, providing short-term forecasts for the world broadband and mobile telecommunications' penetration. The results reveal that the methodology is capable of producing improved one-year-ahead predictions, after a certain level of penetration, as compared to the results of both methods individually. This methodology can find applications to all cases of the high-technology market, where a diffusion model is usually used for obtaining future forecasts.

In this context, the aim of this study was the development and validation of models using fuzzy logic for predicting climate indices and productive performance of European quails kept in a climatic chamber. The model developed was analyzed from two points of view; the first one took into account the prediction of climate indexes where the input variables were the temperature (Â°C) and relative humidity (%) of the air. In the second, related to the prediction of productive performance, the input variables were air temperature (Â°C) and age of the birds (weeks) while the output variables were the food intake (FI, g), water consumption (WC, g), weight gain (WG, g) and food conversion (FC g g-1) of the birds. The Mamdani method was used for the preparation of the rules, and in the defuzzification was applied the center of gravity method. Based on the results generated by the models and compared with the experimental data it was obtained coefficients of determination (R1) of: 0.9771; 0.9897; 0.9955; 0.9995; 0.9993 and 0.9788, for BGTHI, RTL, WC, FI, WG and FC, respectively.},

Using both historical spending data and rigorous experiments, the authors examine how and why economic recessions influence women's consumer behavior. Findings revealed that recessionary cuesâwhether naturally occurring or experimentally primedâdecreased desire for most products (e.g., electronics, household items). However, these cues consistently increased women's desire for products that increase attractiveness to matesâthe first experimental demonstration of the lipstick effect. Additional studies show that this effect is driven by women's desire to attract mates with resources and depends on the perceived mate attraction function served by these products. In addition to showing how and why economic recessions influence women's desire for beauty products, this research provides novel insights into women's mating psychology, consumer behavior, and the relationship between the two.},

abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. With widespread and growing use of smart phones and mobile devices, the use of mobile health (mHealth) in transmission of physiologic parameters and patient-referred symptoms to healthcare providers and researchers, as well as reminders and care plan applications from providers to patients, has potential to revolutionize both clinical care and the conduct of clinical trials with improved designs, data capture, and potentially lower costs. In randomized early phase proof-of-concept studies, focusing on lifestyle intervention, there is evidence that mHealth technology can improve outcomes. By contrast, results from small randomized controlled trials that tested mHealth interventions in heart failure patients were disappointing with inconsistent findings. These inconclusive results could be partially attributed to a lack of methodological rigor (insufficient sample size, quasi-experimental design, inadequate mHealth equipment). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop systematic evidence-based guidelines and parameters for mHealth to be effectively utilized in cardiovascular clinical trials.},

abstract = {Multi-task learns multiple tasks, while sharing knowledge and computation among them. However, it suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge when learned incrementally without access to the old data. Most existing object detectors are domain-specific and static, while some are learned incrementally but only within a single domain. Training an object detector incrementally across various domains has rarely been explored. In this work, we propose three incremental learning scenarios across various domains and categories for object detection. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, attentive feature distillation is proposed to leverages both bottom-up and top-down attentions to extract important information for distillation. We then systematically analyze the proposed distillation method in different scenarios. We find out that, contrary to common understanding, domain gaps have smaller negative impact on incremental detection, while category differences are problematic. For the difficult cases, where the domain gaps and especially category differences are large, we explore three different exemplar sampling methods and show the proposed adaptive sampling method is effective to select diverse and informative samples from entire datasets, to further prevent forgetting. Experimental results show that we achieve the significant improvement in three different scenarios across seven object detection benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {Class incremental learning is an online learning paradigm wherein the classes to be recognized are gradually increased with limited memory, storing only a partial set of examples of past tasks. At a task transition, we observe an unintentional imbalance of confidence or likelihood between the classes of the past and the new task. We argue that the imbalance aggravates a catastrophic forgetting for class incremental learning. We propose a simple yet effective learning objective to balance the confidence of classes of old tasks and new task in the class incremental learning setup. In addition, we compare various sample memory configuring strategies and propose a novel sample memory management policy to alleviate the forgetting further. The proposed method outperforms the state of the arts in many evaluation metrics including accuracy and forgetting F by a large margin (up to 5.71% in A10 and 17.1% in F10) in extensive empirical validations on multiple visual recognition datasets such as CIFAR100, TinyImageNet and a subset of the ImageNet.},

abstract = {In the context of energy saving and carbon emission reduction, the electric vehicle (EV) has been identified as a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuel-driven vehicles. Due to a different refueling manner and driving characteristic, the introduction of EVs to the current logistics system can make a significant impact on the vehicle routing and the associated operation costs. Based on the traveling salesman problem, this paper proposes a new optimal EV route model considering the fast-charging and regular-charging under the time-of-use price in the electricity market. The proposed model aims to minimize the total distribution costs of the EV route while satisfying the constraints of battery capacity, charging time and delivery/pickup demands, and the impact of vehicle loading on the unit electricity consumption per mile. To solve the proposed model, this paper then develops a learnable partheno-genetic algorithm with integration of expert knowledge about EV charging station and customer selection. A comprehensive numerical test is conducted on the 36-node and 112-node systems, and the results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm.},

abstract = {The current research explores whether momentary changes in power can shift professional interview outcomes. Two experiments manipulated power by asking applicants to recall a time they had or lacked power prior to writing a job application letter (Experiment 1) or being interviewed for admission to business schools (Experiment 2). Independent judges, who were unaware of the applicants' experimental condition or even the existence of the power manipulation, significantly preferred the written and face-to-face interview performance of powerful applicants to that of powerless (Experiments 1 and 2) or power-neutral applicants (Experiment 2). In addition, the judges' preference for power-primed applicants was mediated by perceptions of the applicant's persuasiveness. Overall, merely asking participants to remember a personal experience with power dramatically affected the impressions that interviewers had of them. Our findings illustrate power's far-reaching effects and have potentially important implications for understanding the psychology of job interviews. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Different sources contribute complementary explanatory factors and get combined based on factors they share. This system motivated the design of powerful unsupervised representation-learning algorithms. In this paper, we unify recent work on multimodal self-supervised learning under a single framework. Observing that most self-supervised methods optimize similarity metrics between a set of model components, we propose a taxonomy of all reasonable ways to organize this process. We empirically show on two versions of multimodal MNIST and a multimodal brain imaging dataset that (1) multimodal contrastive learning has significant benefits over its unimodal counterpart, (2) the specific composition of multiple contrastive objectives is critical to performance on a downstream task, (3) maximization of the similarity between representations has a regularizing effect on a neural network, which sometimes can lead to reduced downstream performance but still can reveal multimodal relations. Consequently, we outperform previous unsupervised encoder-decoder methods based on CCA or variational mixtures MMVAE on various datasets on linear evaluation protocol.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.},

abstract = {The complex temporal heterogeneity of rainfall coupled with mountainous physiographic context makes a great challenge in the development of accurate short-term rainfall forecasts. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of multiple rainfall sources (gauge measurement, and radar and satellite products) for assimilation-based multi-sensor precipitation estimates and make multi-step-ahead rainfall forecasts based on the assimilated precipitation. Bias correction procedures for both radar and satellite precipitation products were first built, and the radar and satellite precipitation products were generated through the Quantitative Precipitation Estimation and Segregation Using Multiple Sensors (QPESUMS) and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS), respectively. Next, the synthesized assimilated precipitation was obtained by merging three precipitation sources (gauges, radars and satellites) according to their individual weighting factors optimized by nonlinear search methods. Finally, the multi-step-ahead rainfall forecasting was carried out by using the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The Shihmen Reservoir watershed in northern Taiwan was the study area, where 641 hourly data sets of thirteen historical typhoon events were collected. Results revealed that the bias adjustments in QPESUMS and PERSIANN-CCS products did improve the accuracy of these precipitation products (in particular, 30-60% improvement rates for the QPESUMS, in terms of RMSE), and the adjusted PERSIANN-CCS and QPESUMS individually provided about 10% and 24% contribution accordingly to the assimilated precipitation. As far as rainfall forecasting is concerned, the results demonstrated that the ANFIS fed with the assimilated precipitation provided reliable and stable forecasts with the correlation coefficients higher than 0.85 and 0.72 for one- and two-hour-ahead rainfall forecasting, respectively. The obtained forecasting results are very valuable information for the flood warning in the study watershed during typhoon periods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Since machine learning techniques are more robust to perturbations, in this paper we explore their application to weather forecasting to potentially generate more accurate weather forecasts for large periods of time. The scope of this paper was restricted to forecasting the maximum temperature and the minimum tem- perature for seven days, given weather data for the past two days. A linear regression model and a variation on a functional regression model were used, with the latter able to capture trends in the weather. Both of our models were outperformed by professional weather forecasting services, although the discrepancy between our models and the professional ones diminished rapidly for fore- casts of later days, and perhaps for even longer time scales our models could outperform professional ones. The linear regression model outperformed the functional regression model, suggesting that two days were too short for the latter to capture significant weather trends, and perhaps basing our forecasts on weather data for four or five days would allow the functional regression model to outperform the linear regression model.},

Each company or organization has a value creating process that usually involves people, machines and information. One of the main problems with such processes is that it is very difficult to predict how much of each resource is actually needed. In light of the above, the objective of this paper is to implement a methodology that is capable of optimizing the allocation of resources to tasks in a given business process. In this paper, the genetic algorithm was used for optimization. The idea is that once the units are properly presented, the optimal schedule of users should be determined using the genetic algorithm. The fitness function includes Key Performance Indicators of process: waiting time and cost of the resource. Since al the users are not qualified in performing all the tasks in the process, the algorithm has to consider minimal and the maximal available number of users for each activity. The usability of this approach is tested in the process of credit requirement. Finally, the results are compared to the current work process.},

abstract = {The objectives of this paper are (1) to have a detailed, practical discussion of Industry 4.0, and (2) to suggest policy implications to transition toward Industry 4.0 in Korea. Companies should consider Industry 4.0 very seriously as they develop their future initiatives since traditional manufacturing business models do not fit with the emerging technologies of Industry 4.0. Some issues should be addressed with care: IT security, reliability and stability needed for critical machine-to-machine communication; a need to maintain the integrity of production processes, avoid IT snags, and protect industrial knowhow; and the lack of adequate skill-sets, general reluctance to change by stakeholders, and loss of many jobs to automatic processes and IT-controlled processes. To successfully transform Korean industry toward Industry 4.0, it is necessary to (1) refine and elaborate the strategies enacted by the central government to build economic and social systems that can flexibly respond to changes, (2) establish some kind of operational system to maximize the effectiveness of initiatives and policies, (3) develop concrete and workable action plans to transition toward economic and social systems that can accommodate innovative changes, and (4) establish infrastructure to lead all initiatives.},

Power loss reductions, voltage profile improvement and increasing reliability are some advantages of DG units. The above benefits can be achieved by optimal placement of DGs. Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), a novel metaheuristic algorithm, is used to determine the optimal DG size. WOA is modeled based on the unique hunting behavior of humpback whales. The WOA is evaluated on IEEE 15, 33, 69 and 85-bus test systems. WOA was compared with different types of DGs and other evolutionary algorithms.

abstract = {Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, we introduce âdeep compressionâ, a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35Ã to 49Ã without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9Ã to 13Ã; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35Ã, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49Ã from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3Ã to 4Ã layerwise speedup and 3Ã to 7Ã better energy efficiency.},

We explore an example of such an approach in which dense tracklets are described relative to multiple reference trajectories, providing a rich representation of complex interactions between objects of which only a subset can be tracked. Specifically, we report experiments in which reference trajectories are provided by tracking inertial sensors in a food preparation scenario. Additionally, we provide baseline results for HOG, HOF and MBH, and combine these features with others for multi-modal recognition. The proposed histograms of relative tracklets (RETLETS) showed better activity recognition performance than dense tracklets, HOG, HOF, MBH, or their combination. Our comparative evaluation of features from accelerometers and video highlighted a performance gap between visual and accelerometer-based motion features and showed a substantial performance gain when combining features from these sensor modalities. A considerable further performance gain was observed in combination with RETLETS and reference tracklet features.},

abstract = {Increasing the batch size is a popular way to speed up neural network training, but beyond some critical batch size, larger batch sizes yield diminishing returns. In this work, we study how the critical batch size changes based on properties of the optimization algorithm, including acceleration and preconditioning, through two different lenses: Large scale experiments, and analysis of a simple noisy quadratic model (NQM). We experimentally demonstrate that optimization algorithms that employ preconditioning, specifically Adam and K-FAC, result in much larger critical batch sizes than stochastic gradient descent with momentum. We also demonstrate that the NQM captures many of the essential features of real neural network training, despite being drastically simpler to work with. The NQM predicts our results with preconditioned optimizers, previous results with accelerated gradient descent, and other results around optimal learning rates and large batch training, making it a useful tool to generate testable predictions about neural network optimization.},

The monitoring of environmental conditions of cities can help to adapt the indoor locations of the cities in order to be more comfortable for people who stay there. A way to improve the indoor conditions is an efficient temperature control, however, it depends on many factors like the different combinations of outdoor temperature and humidity. Therefore, adjusting the indoor temperature is not setting a value according to other value. There are many more factors to take into consideration, hence the traditional logic based in binary states cannot be used. Many problems cannot be solved with a set of binary solutions and we need a new way of development. Fuzzy logic is able to interpret many states, more than two states, giving to computers the capacity to react in a similar way to people. In this paper we will propose a new approach to control the temperature using the Internet of Things together its platforms and fuzzy logic regarding not only the indoor temperature but also the outdoor temperature and humidity in order to save energy and to set a more comfortable environment for their users. Finally, we will conclude that the fuzzy approach allows us to achieve an energy saving around 40% and thus, save money.},

In this paper we focus on class incremental continual learning in semantic segmentation, where new categories are made available over time while previous training data is not retained. The proposed continual learning scheme shapes the latent space to reduce forgetting whilst improving the recognition of novel classes. Our framework is driven by three novel components which we also combine on top of existing techniques effortlessly. First, prototypes matching enforces latent space consistency on old classes, constraining the encoder to produce similar latent representation for previously seen classes in the subsequent steps. Second, features sparsification allows to make room in the latent space to accommodate novel classes. Finally, contrastive learning is employed to cluster features according to their semantics while tearing apart those of different classes. Extensive evaluation on the Pascal VOC2012 and ADE20K datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Unlike humans, when these networks are trained on something new, they rapidly forget what was learned before. In the brain, a mechanism thought to be important for protecting memories is the reactivation of neuronal activity patterns representing those memories. In artificial neural networks, such memory replay can be implemented as âgenerative replay', which can successfully â and surprisingly efficiently â prevent catastrophic forgetting on toy examples even in a class-incremental learning scenario. However, scaling up generative replay to complicated problems with many tasks or complex inputs is challenging. We propose a new, brain-inspired variant of replay in which internal or hidden representations are replayed that are generated by the network's own, context-modulated feedback connections. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging continual learning benchmarks (e.g., class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100) without storing data, and it provides a novel model for replay in the brain.},

Additionally, conflict reduction is proposed to resolve the conflicts of pseudo labels generated from both the old and new models. We show that maximizing self-entropy can further improve results by smoothing the overconfident predictions.

Leveraging data augmentations is a promising direction towards addressing this challenge. Here, we perform a systematic study of the Copy-Paste augmentation ([13, 12]) for instance segmentation where we randomly paste objects onto an image. Prior studies on Copy-Paste relied on modeling the surrounding visual context for pasting the objects. However, we find that the simple mechanism of pasting objects randomly is good enough and can provide solid gains on top of strong baselines. Furthermore, we show Copy-Paste is additive with semi-supervised methods that leverage extra data through pseudo labeling (e.g. self-training). On COCO instance segmentation, we achieve 49.1 mask AP and 57.3 box AP, an improvement of +0.6 mask AP and +1.5 box AP over the previous state-of-the-art.

abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)âa blind assessment of the state of the fieldâAlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains.

@article{Pajarinen2017,
abstract = {This paper investigates manipulation of multiple unknown objects in a crowded environment. Because of incomplete knowledge due to unknown objects and occlusions in visual observations, object observations are imperfect and action success is uncertain, making planning challenging. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which allows a general reward based optimization objective and takes uncertainty in temporal evolution and partial observations into account. In addition to occlusion dependent observation and action success probabilities, our POMDP model also automatically adapts object specific action success probabilities. To cope with the changing system dynamics and performance constraints, we present a new online POMDP method based on particle filtering that produces compact policies. The approach is validated both in simulation and in physical experiments in a scenario of moving dirty dishes into a dishwasher. The results indicate that: 1) a greedy heuristic manipulation approach is not sufficient, multi-object manipulation requires multi-step POMDP planning, and 2) on-line planning is beneficial since it allows the adaptation of the system dynamics model based on actual experience.},

abstract = {Quadratic regularizers are often used for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks (DNNs), but are unable to compete with recent continual learning methods. To understand this behavior, we analyze parameter updates under quadratic regularization and demonstrate such regularizers prevent forgetting of past tasks by implicitly performing a weighted average between current and previous values of model parameters. Our analysis shows the inferior performance of quadratic regularizers arises from (a) dependence of weighted averaging on training hyperparameters, which often results in unstable training and (b) assignment of lower importance to deeper layers, which are generally the cause for forgetting in DNNs. To address these limitations, we propose Explicit Movement Regularization (EMR), a continual learning algorithm that modifies quadratic regularization to remove the dependence of weighted averaging on training hyperparameters and uses a relative measure for importance to avoid problems caused by lower importance assignment to deeper layers. Compared to quadratic regularization, EMR achieves 6.2% higher average accuracy and 4.5% lower average forgetting.},

A sequence oftasks is learned, one at a time, with all data ofcurrent task available but not ofprevious or future tasks. Task boundaries and identities are known at all times. This setup, however, is rarely encountered in practi- cal applications. Therefore we investigate how to transform continual learning to an online setup. We develop a sys- tem that keeps on learning over time in a streaming fash- ion, with data distributions gradually changing and with- out the notion of separate tasks. To this end, we build on the work on Memory Aware Synapses, and show how this method can be made online by providing a protocol to de- cide i) when to update the importance weights, ii) which data to use to update them, and iii) how to accumulate the importance weights at each update step.

abstract = {Natural gradient descent is an optimization method traditionally motivated from the perspective of information geometry, and works well for many applications as an alternative to stochastic gradient descent. In this paper we critically analyze this method and its properties, and show how it can be viewed as a type of 2nd-order optimization method, with the Fisher information matrix acting as a substitute for the Hessian. In many important cases, the Fisher information matrix is shown to be equivalent to the Generalized Gauss-Newton matrix, which both approximates the Hessian, but also has certain properties that favor its use over the Hessian. This perspective turns out to have significant implications for the design of a practical and robust natural gradient optimizer, as it motivates the use of techniques like trust regions and Tikhonov regularization. Additionally, we make a series of contributions to the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods, including: a thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used \empirical"approximation of the Fisher matrix, and an analysis of the (approximate) parameterization invariance property possessed by natural gradient methods (which we show also holds for certain other curvature matrices, but notably not the Hessian).},

A majority of the current methods replay previous data during training, which violates the constraints of an ideal continual learning system. Additionally, current approaches that deal with forgetting ignore the problem of catastrophic remembering, i.e. the worsening ability to discriminate between data from different tasks. In our work, we introduce Relevance Mapping Networks (RMNs) which are inspired by the Optimal Overlap Hypothesis. The mappings reflects the relevance of the weights for the task at hand by assigning large weights to essential parameters. We show that RMNs learn an optimized representational overlap that overcomes the twin problem of catastrophic forgetting and remembering. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all common continual learning datasets, even significantly outperforming data replay methods while not violating the constraints for an ideal continual learning system. Moreover, RMNs retain the ability to detect data from new tasks in an unsupervised manner, thus proving their resilience against catastrophic remembering.},

Questioning the premise of previous studies that ID and OOD samples are separated distinctly, we consider samples lying in the intermediate of the two and use them for training a network. We generate such samples using multiple image transformations that corrupt inputs in various ways and with different severity levels. We estimate where the generated samples by a single image transformation lie between ID and OOD using a network trained on clean ID samples. To be specific, we make the network classify the generated samples and calculate their mean classification accuracy, using which we create a soft target label for them. We train the same network from scratch using the original ID samples and the generated samples with the soft labels created for them. We detect OOD samples by thresholding the entropy of the predicted softmax probability. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in the standard benchmark tests. We also analyze the effect of the number and particular combinations of image corrupting transformations on the performance .},

abstract = {Neural networks are prone to learning shortcuts -- they often model simple correlations, ignoring more complex ones that potentially generalize better. Prior works on image classification show that instead of learning a connection to object shape, deep classifiers tend to exploit spurious correlations with low-level texture or the background for solving the classification task. In this work, we take a step towards more robust and interpretable classifiers that explicitly expose the task's causal structure. Building on current advances in deep generative modeling, we propose to decompose the image generation process into independent causal mechanisms that we train without direct supervision. By exploiting appropriate inductive biases, these mechanisms disentangle object shape, object texture, and background; hence, they allow for generating counterfactual images. We demonstrate the ability of our model to generate such images on MNIST and ImageNet. Further, we show that the counterfactual images can improve out-of-distribution robustness with a marginal drop in performance on the original classification task, despite being synthetic. Lastly, our generative model can be trained efficiently on a single GPU, exploiting common pre-trained models as inductive biases.},

Furthermore, we observed that the forgetting problem occurs between mini-batches when performing general training processes using stochastic gradient descent methods, and this problem is one of the factors that degrades generalization performance of the network. We also try to solve this problem using the proposed method. Finally, we show our less-forgetting learning method is also helpful to improve the performance of deep neural networks in terms of recognition rates.},

abstract = {Continual learning (CL) is a particular machine learning paradigm where the data distribution and learning objective change through time, or where all the training data and objective criteria are never available at once. The evolution of the learning process is modeled by a sequence of learning experiences where the goal is to be able to learn new skills all along the sequence without forgetting what has been previously learned. CL can be seen as an online learning where knowledge fusion needs to take place in order to learn from streams of data presented sequentially in time. Continual learning also aims at the same time at optimizing the memory, the computation power and the speed during the learning process. An important challenge for machine learning is not necessarily finding solutions that work in the real world but rather finding stable algorithms that can learn in real world. Hence, the ideal approach would be tackling the real world in a embodied platform: an autonomous agent. Continual learning would then be effective in an autonomous agent or robot, which would learn autonomously through time about the external world, and incrementally develop a set of complex skills and knowledge.Robotic agents have to learn to adapt and interact with their environment using a continuous stream of observations. Some recent approaches aim at tackling continual learning for robotics, but most recent papers on continual learning only experiment approaches in simulation or with static datasets. Unfortunately, the evaluation of those algorithms does not provide insights on whether their solutions may help continual learning in the context of robotics. This paper aims at reviewing the existing state of the art of continual learning, summarizing existing benchmarks and metrics, and proposing a framework for presenting and evaluating both robotics and non robotics approaches in a way that makes transfer between both fields easier. We put light on continual learning in the context of robotics to create connections between fields and normalize approaches.},

These networks are thus prone to malicious attacks that perturb the inputs to force a misclassification. Such slightly manipulated images aimed at deceiving the classifier are known as adversarial images. In this work, we investigate statistical differences between natural images and adversarial ones. More precisely, we show that employing a proper image transformation and for a class of adversarial attacks, the distribution of the leading digit of the pixels in adversarial images deviates from Benford's law. The stronger the attack, the more distant the resulting distribution is from Benford's law. Our analysis provides a detailed investigation of this new approach that can serve as a basis for alternative adversarial example detection methods that do not need to modify the original CNN classifier neither work on the raw high-dimensional pixels as features to defend against attacks.},

In such settings, the RBMonly yields a preprocessing or an initialization for some other model, instead of acting as a complete supervised model in its own right. In this paper, we argue that RBMs can provide a self-contained framework for developing competitive classifiers. We study the Classification RBM (ClassRBM), a variant on the RBM adapted to the classification setting. We study different strategies for training the ClassRBM and show that competitive classification performances can be reached when appropriately combining discriminative and generative training objectives. Since training according to the generative objective requires the computation of a generally intractable gradient, we also compare different approaches to estimating this gradient and address the issue of obtaining such a gradient for problems with very high dimensional inputs. Finally, we describe how to adapt the ClassRBM to two special cases of classification problems, namely semi-supervised and multitask learning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Hugo Larochelle, Michael Mandel, Razvan Pascanu and Yoshua Bengio.},

abstract = {We introduce the "Incremental Implicitly-Refined Classi-fication (IIRC)" setup, an extension to the class incremental learning setup where the incoming batches of classes have two granularity levels. i.e., each sample could have a high-level (coarse) label like "bear" and a low-level (fine) label like "polar bear". Only one label is provided at a time, and the model has to figure out the other label if it has already learnfed it. This setup is more aligned with real-life scenarios, where a learner usually interacts with the same family of entities multiple times, discovers more granularity about them, while still trying not to forget previous knowledge. Moreover, this setup enables evaluating models for some important lifelong learning challenges that cannot be easily addressed under the existing setups. These challenges can be motivated by the example "if a model was trained on the class bear in one task and on polar bear in another task, will it forget the concept of bear, will it rightfully infer that a polar bear is still a bear? and will it wrongfully associate the label of polar bear to other breeds of bear?". We develop a standardized benchmark that enables evaluating models on the IIRC setup. We evaluate several state-of-the-art lifelong learning algorithms and highlight their strengths and limitations. For example, distillation-based methods perform relatively well but are prone to incorrectly predicting too many labels per image. We hope that the proposed setup, along with the benchmark, would provide a meaningful problem setting to the practitioners},

The framework is mediated by potentiation and depression stimulation that play opposing roles in directing synaptic and behavioral plasticity.

A three-way tension exists between the allocation of computing resources to refine model resolution, the expansion of model complexity/capability, and the increase of ensemble size. Here we review evidence for the benefits of increased ocean resolution in global coupled models, where the ocean component explicitly represents transient mesoscale eddies and narrow boundary currents. We consider lessons learned from forced ocean/sea-ice simulations; from studies concerning the SST resolution required to impact atmospheric simulations; and from coupled predictions. Impacts of the mesoscale ocean in western boundary current regions on the large-scale atmospheric state have been identified. Understanding of air-sea feedback in western boundary currents is modifying our view of the dynamics in these key regions. It remains unclear whether variability associated with open ocean mesoscale eddies is equally important to the large-scale atmospheric state. We include a discussion of what processes can presently be parameterised in coupled models with coarse resolution non-eddying ocean models, and where parameterizations may fall short. We discuss the benefits of resolution and identify gaps in the current literature that leave important questions unanswered.},

A hard attention mask is learned concurrently to every task, through stochastic gradient descent, and previous masks are exploited to condition such learning. We show that the proposed mechanism is effective for reducing catastrophic forgetting, cutting current rates by 45 to 80%. We also show that it is robust to different hyperparameter choices, and that it offers a number of monitoring capabilities.

If that hypothesis was correct, we could more easily both understand our own intelligence and build intelligent machines. Just like in physics, the principles themselves would not be sufficient to predict the behavior of complex systems like brains, and substantial computation might be needed to simulate human-like intelligence. This hypothesis would suggest that studying the kind of inductive biases that humans and animals exploit could help both clarify these principles and provide inspiration for AI research and neuroscience theories. Deep learning already exploits several key inductive biases, and this work considers a larger list, focusing on those which concern mostly higher-level and sequential conscious processing. The objective of clarifying these particular principles is that they could potentially help us build AI systems benefiting from humans' abilities in terms of flexible out-of-distribution and systematic generalization, which is currently an area where a large gap exists between state-of-the-art machine learning and human intelligence.},

abstract = {Knowledge distillation is an effective approach to leverage a well-trained network or an ensemble of them, named as the teacher, to guide the training of a student network. The outputs from the teacher network are used as soft labels for supervising the training of a new network. Recent studies \citep{muller2019does,yuan2020revisiting} revealed an intriguing property of the soft labels that making labels soft serves as a good regularization to the student network. From the perspective of statistical learning, regularization aims to reduce the variance, however how bias and variance change is not clear for training with soft labels. In this paper, we investigate the bias-variance tradeoff brought by distillation with soft labels. Specifically, we observe that during training the bias-variance tradeoff varies sample-wisely. Further, under the same distillation temperature setting, we observe that the distillation performance is negatively associated with the number of some specific samples, which are named as regularization samples since these samples lead to bias increasing and variance decreasing. Nevertheless, we empirically find that completely filtering out regularization samples also deteriorates distillation performance. Our discoveries inspired us to propose the novel weighted soft labels to help the network adaptively handle the sample-wise bias-variance tradeoff. Experiments on standard evaluation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/bellymonster/Weighted-Soft-Label-Distillation}.},

Importantly, precise forecasts of space weather conditions and appropriate hazard observant cautions required for ionospheric space weather observations are limited. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based gradient descent method has been proposed to forecast the ionospheric TEC values. In this technique, membership functions have been tuned based on the gradient descent estimated values. The proposed algorithm has been tested with the TEC data of two geomagnetic storms in the low latitude station of KL University, Guntur, India (16.44Â°N, 80.62Â°E). It has been found that the gradient descent method performs well and the predicted TEC values are close to the original TEC measurements.},

abstract = {Object detection remains an active area of research in the field of computer vision, and considerable advances and successes has been achieved in this area through the design of deep convolutional neural networks for tackling object detection. Despite these successes, one of the biggest challenges to widespread deployment of such object detection networks on edge and mobile scenarios is the high computational and memory requirements. As such, there has been growing research interest in the design of efficient deep neural network architectures catered for edge and mobile usage. In this study, we introduce YOLO Nano, a highly compact deep convolutional neural network for the task of object detection. A human-machine collaborative design strategy is leveraged to create YOLO Nano, where principled network design prototyping, based on design principles from the YOLO family of single-shot object detection network architectures, is coupled with machine-driven design exploration to create a compact network with highly customized module-level macroarchitecture and microarchitecture designs tailored for the task of embedded object detection. The proposed YOLO Nano possesses a model size of $\sim$4.0MB (>15.1x and >8.3x smaller than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively) and requires 4.57B operations for inference (>34% and $\sim$17% lower than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively) while still achieving an mAP of $\sim$69.1% on the VOC 2007 dataset ($\sim$12% and $\sim$10.7% higher than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively). Experiments on inference speed and power efficiency on a Jetson AGX Xavier embedded module at different power budgets further demonstrate the efficacy of YOLO Nano for embedded scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper describes LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine), a compiler framework designed to support transparent, life-long program analysis and transformation for arbitrary programs, by providing high-level information to compiler transformations at compile-time, link-time, run-time, and in idle time between runs. LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in Static Single Assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.},

The MRA is made of a thin birefringence plate, and is composed of identical units that have pixels of four different thicknesses. We demonstrate that pixelated phase delay between two shearing beams can be introduced by applying the fast axis of birefringence plate in the horizontal or vertical orientation. We also present an approach to extract the wavefront under test with random phase shift, which dramatically reduces the machining difficulty of the MRA. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method are further validated through our numerical analysis. With the advantages of vibration immunity, simultaneous phase stepping, and broad spectral range, the presented interferometer is expected to be of potential use in a variety of applications, such as the detection of moving objects and dynamic processes.},

PCL implicitly encodes semantic structures of the data into the learned embedding space, and prevents the network from solely relying on low-level cues for solving unsupervised learning tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototypes as latent variables to help find the maximumlikelihood estimation of the network parameters in an Expectation-Maximization framework. We iteratively perform E-step as finding the distribution of prototypes via clustering and M-step as optimizing the network via contrastive learning. We propose ProtoNCE loss, a generalized version of the InfoNCE loss for contrastive learning by encouraging representations to be closer to their assigned prototypes. PCL achieves state-of-The-Art results on multiple unsupervised representation learning benchmarks, with 10% accuracy improvement in low-resource transfer tasks.

abstract = {In spite of remarkable success of the convolutional neural networks on semantic segmentation, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting: A significant performance drop for the already learned classes when new classes are added on the data having no annotations for the old classes. We propose an incremental learning methodology, enabling to learn segmenting new classes without hindering dense labeling abilities for the previous classes, although the entire previous data are not accessible. The key points of the proposed approach are adapting the network to learn new as well as old classes on the new training data, and allowing it to remember the previously learned information for the old classes. For adaptation, we keep a frozen copy of the previously trained network, which is used as a memory for the updated network in the absence of annotations for the former classes. The updated network minimizes a loss function, which balances the discrepancy between outputs for the previous classes from the memory and updated networks, and the misclassification rate between outputs for the new classes from the updated network and the new ground-Truth. For remembering, we either regularly feed samples from the stored, little fraction of the previous data or use the memory network, depending on whether the new data are collected from completely different geographic areas or from the same city. Our experimental results prove that it is possible to add new classes to the network, while maintaining its performance for the previous classes, despite the whole previous training data are not available.},

abstract = {In machinery maintenance policies, regular inspection intervals should be specified in such a way that the cumulative of direct and indirect financial consequences of maintenance activities should be minimized while supporting the functional health of system components. This study aims to develop a simulation algorithm, called the time-counter, to optimize inspection intervals. In the algorithm, uptime and downtime behaviors of the system components and production losses in the corrective repairs are considered random values. Delay time concept is regarded when estimating failure detection periods and deciding on the required maintenance type. In addition, the developed model is applied to two active draglines and their inspection intervals are optimized as 232 and 184 h for Dragline-1 and Dragline-2, respectively. The optimized values are observed to decrease the total maintenance costs by 5.9 and 6.2 percent for the given draglines, compared to the current interval of 160 h. The main novelties of the study are that (i) the proposed concept which allows for simultaneous assessment of system components in an incremental time span has not been proposed in the literature when deciding on optimal inspection intervals, (ii) it is the first initiative in inspection optimization of a mining machinery system, and (iii) it uses real datasets on lifetime, repair time, and financial values that are rarely observed in maintenance studies.},

abstract = {Modern machine learning models for computer vision exceed humans in accuracy on specific visual recognition tasks, notably on datasets like ImageNet. However, high accuracy can be achieved in many ways. The particular decision function found by a machine learning system is determined not only by the data to which the system is exposed, but also the inductive biases of the model, which are typically harder to characterize. In this work, we follow a recent trend of in-depth behavioral analyses of neural network models that go beyond accuracy as an evaluation metric by looking at patterns of errors. Our focus is on comparing a suite of standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a recently-proposed attention-based network, the Vision Transformer (ViT), which relaxes the translation-invariance constraint of CNNs and therefore represents a model with a weaker set of inductive biases. Attention-based networks have previously been shown to achieve higher accuracy than CNNs on vision tasks, and we demonstrate, using new metrics for examining error consistency with more granularity, that their errors are also more consistent with those of humans. These results have implications both for building more human-like vision models, as well as for understanding visual object recognition in humans.},

abstract = {Accurate wind speed prediction is a significant factor in improving and optimizing wind power production. Particularly, reliable short-term wind speed forecasting contributes to the real-time optimization of wind farm operation. However, this short-term forecasting task remains challenging due to the strong stochastic nature and dynamic uncertainty of wind speed. This paper proposes a hybrid model that consists of the Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT), Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm and Gaussian process regression with the Student-t Observation Model (GPR-t) for short-term wind speed forecasting. The proposed approach firstly extracts meaningful information from a short-term wind speed series and subsequently models the inherent uncertainty and the dynamic features of the wind speed time-series. Additionally, the wind speed series presents a time-varying characteristic. Thus, this study adopts a moving window approach in the prediction processes, thereby permitting the proposed model to respond quickly to the dynamic characteristic of wind speed. To examine the forecasting performance of the suggested hybrid model, the validation of the proposed model is performed against several other existing models with half-hour and hourly wind speed data obtained from a windmill farm located in northwestern China. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach generates satisfactory point predictive accuracy and interval forecasting performance.},

abstract = {Class-incremental learning of deep networks sequentially increases the number of classes to be classified. During training, the network has only access to data of one task at a time, where each task contains several classes. In this setting, networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting which refers to the drastic drop in performance on previous tasks. The vast majority of methods have studied this scenario for classification networks, where for each new task the classification layer of the network must be augmented with additional weights to make room for the newly added classes. Embedding networks have the advantage that new classes can be naturally included into the network without adding new weights. Therefore, we study incremental learning for embedding networks. In addition, we propose a new method to estimate the drift, called semantic drift, of features and compensate for it without the need of any exemplars. We approximate the drift of previous tasks based on the drift that is experienced by current task data. We perform experiments on fine-grained datasets, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-Subset. We demonstrate that embedding networks suffer significantly less from catastrophic forgetting. We outperform existing methods which do not require exemplars and obtain competitive results compared to methods which store exemplars. Furthermore, we show that our proposed SDC when combined with existing methods to prevent forgetting consistently improves results.},

abstract = {This study presents a model to forecast the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) (JuneâSeptember) based on monthly and seasonal time scales. The ISMR time series data sets are classified into two parts for modeling purposes, viz., (1) training data set (1871â1960), and (2) testing data set (1961â2014). Statistical analyzes reflect the dynamic nature of the ISMR, which couldn't be predicted efficiently by statistical and mathematical based models. Therefore, this study suggests the usage of three techniques, viz., fuzzy set, entropy and artificial neural network (ANN). Based on these techniques, a novel ISMR time series forecasting model is designed to deal with the dynamic nature of the ISMR. This model is verified and validated with training and testing data sets. Various statistical analyzes and comparison studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

@article{Dhar2019,
abstract = {Incremental learning (IL) is an important task aimed at increasing the capability of a trained model, in terms of the number of classes recognizable by the model. The key problem in this task is the requirement of storing data (e.g. images) associated with existing classes, while teaching the classifier to learn new classes. However, this is impractical as it increases the memory requirement at every incremental step, which makes it impossible to implement IL algorithms on edge devices with limited memory. Hence, we propose a novel approach, called 'Learning without Memorizing (LwM)', to preserve the information about existing (base) classes, without storing any of their data, while making the classifier progressively learn the new classes. In LwM, we present an information preserving penalty: Attention Distillation Loss (L {AD}), and demonstrate that penalizing the changes in classifiers' attention maps helps to retain information of the base classes, as new classes are added. We show that adding L {AD} to the distillation loss which is an existing information preserving loss consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art performance in the iILSVRC-small and iCIFAR-100 datasets in terms of the overall accuracy of base and incrementally learned classes.},

abstract = {A dual-frequency direct detection Doppler lidar is demonstrated using a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) at 1.5 $\mu$m. The so-called double-edge technique is implemented by using a dual-frequency laser pulse, rather than using a double-channel FabryâPerot interferometer. Such a modification to the reported lidars enhances the frequency stability in the system level. Using the time-division multiplexing method, only one piece of SNSPD is used in the optical receiver, making the system simplified and robust. The SNSPD is adopted to enhance the temporal resolution since it offers merits of high quantum efficiency, low dark count noise, no after-pulsing probability, and a high maximum count rate. Two telescopes that point westward and northward at a zenith angle of 30Â° are used to detect the line-of-sight wind components, which are used to synthesize the horizontal wind profile. Horizontal wind profiles up to an altitude of about 2.7 km are calculated with vertical spatial/temporal resolution of 10 m/10 s. Wind dynamic evolution and vertical wind shears are observed clearly.},

abstract = {Assessment of the output power of wind generators is always associated with some uncertainties due to wind speed and other weather parameters alteration, and precise short-term forecasts are essential for their efficient operation. This can efficiently support transmission and distribution system operators and schedulers to improve the power network control and management. In this paper, we propose a double stage hierarchical particle swarm optimization based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (double-stage hybrid PSO-ANFIS) for short-term wind power prediction of a microgrid wind farm in Beijing, China. The approach has two hierarchical stages. The first PSO-ANFIS stage employs numerical weather prediction (NWP) meteorological parameters to forecast wind speed at the wind farm exact site and turbine hub height. The second stage models the actual wind speed and power relationships. Then, the predicted next day's wind speed by the first stage is applied to the second stage to forecast next day's wind power. The influence of input data dependency on prediction accuracy has been analyzed by dividing the input data into five subsets. The proposed approach has attained significant prediction accuracy improvements. The performance of the proposed model is compared with five other prediction approaches and showed the best accuracy improvement of all. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Despite that deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved enormous success in many domains like natural language processing (NLP), they have also been proven to be vulnerable to maliciously generated adversarial examples. Such inherent vulnerability has threatened various real-world deployed DNNs-based applications. To strength the model robustness, several countermeasures have been proposed in the English NLP domain and obtained satisfactory performance. However, due to the unique language properties of Chinese, it is not trivial to extend existing defenses to the Chinese domain. Therefore, we propose AdvGraph, a novel defense which enhances the robustness of Chinese-based NLP models by incorporating adversarial knowledge into the semantic representation of the input. Extensive experiments on two real-world tasks show that AdvGraph exhibits better performance compared with previous work: (i) effective - it significantly strengthens the model robustness even under the adaptive attacks setting without negative impact on model performance over legitimate input; (ii) generic - its key component, i.e., the representation of connotative adversarial knowledge is task-agnostic, which can be reused in any Chinese-based NLP models without retraining; and (iii) efficient - it is a light-weight defense with sub-linear computational complexity, which can guarantee the efficiency required in practical scenarios.},

Digital developments like cyber-physical Systems are the key technologies for future, more agile production systems but a common understanding of the term Industry 4.0 is not established in this time. First generic implementation approaches present manifold technical solutions but miss an integrated consideration with existing Lean Production Systems. The actual impact of Industry 4.0 solutions is mostly not clearly specified and a method to evaluate is missing. This paper introduces the Industry 4.0 in an environment of connectability in the Internet of Things and Services with the vision of a smart factory. The initial situation of industrial companies is characterized by Lean Production Systems and Lean Principles. For companies, Industry 4.0 offers an estimated benefit by stabilizing Lean processes with Industry 4.0 applications. To support the development process the presented Concept of an Industry 4.0 impact matrix on lean production systems gives a useable framework. The matrix considers elements of lean production systems with Industry 4.0 technologies and gives a first estimation of impact. In the described development process of a cyber-physical Just-in-Time delivery the matrix is used to find a stabilizing application for a Just-in-Time material supply process.},

@article{Allen-Zhu2020,
abstract = {We formally study how Ensemble of deep learning models can improve test accuracy, and how the superior performance of ensemble can be distilled into a single model using Knowledge Distillation. We consider the challenging case where the ensemble is simply an average of the outputs of a few independently trained neural networks with the SAME architecture, trained using the SAME algorithm on the SAME data set, and they only differ by the random seeds used in the initialization. We empirically show that ensemble/knowledge distillation in deep learning works very differently from traditional learning theory, especially differently from ensemble of random feature mappings or the neural-tangent-kernel feature mappings, and is potentially out of the scope of existing theorems. Thus, to properly understand ensemble and knowledge distillation in deep learning, we develop a theory showing that when data has a structure we refer to as "multi-view", then ensemble of independently trained neural networks can provably improve test accuracy, and such superior test accuracy can also be provably distilled into a single model by training a single model to match the output of the ensemble instead of the true label. Our result sheds light on how ensemble works in deep learning in a way that is completely different from traditional theorems, and how the "dark knowledge" is hidden in the outputs of the ensemble -- that can be used in knowledge distillation -- comparing to the true data labels. In the end, we prove that self-distillation can also be viewed as implicitly combining ensemble and knowledge distillation to improve test accuracy.},

The energy wells for the soft-mode distortion are deeper for rhombohedral [111] displacements relative to tetragonal [001] displacements, but they are relatively shallow and comparable to the transition temperature. The nonrigid part of the charge-density distortion is centered around the Ti ion rather than the O, and the Ti charge is closer to 2.9+ than 4+. There is significant hybridization between the Ti and O, but the Ba is quite ionic and is well described as a Ba2+ ion. The Ti-O hybridization is essential to the ferroelectric instability.},

This includes de-blurring images degraded by the limitations of sensors or source of captures in addition to noise filtering and correction of geometric distortion due to sensors. There are several classical image restoration methods such as Wiener filtering. To find an estimate of the original image, Wiener filter requires the prior knowledge of the degradation phenomenon, the blurred image and the statistical properties of the noise process. In this work, we propose a new rapid and blind algorithm for image restoration that does not require a priori knowledge of the noise distribution. The degraded image is first de-convoluted in Fourier space by parametric Wiener filtering, and then, it is smoothed by the wave atom transform after setting the threshold to its coefficients. Experiment results are significant and show the efficiency of our algorithm compared with other techniques in use.},

abstract = {Background: Many cities across the world are beginning to shift their mobility solution away from the private cars and towards more environmentally friendly and citizen-focused means. Hamburg, Oslo, Helsinki, and Madrid have recently announced their plans to become (partly) private car free cities. Other cities like Paris, Milan, Chengdu, Masdar, Dublin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Bogota, and Hyderabad have measures that aim at reducing motorized traffic including implementing car free days, investing in cycling infrastructure and pedestrianization, restricting parking spaces and considerable increases in public transport provision. Such plans and measures are particularly implemented with the declared aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These reductions are also likely to benefit public health. Aims: We aimed to describe the plans for private car free cities and its likely effects on public health. Methods: We reviewed the grey and scientific literature on plans for private car free cities, restricted car use, related exposures and health. Results: An increasing number of cities are planning to become (partly) private car free. They mainly focus on the reduction of private car use in city centers. The likely effects of such policies are significant reductions in traffic-related air pollution, noise, and temperature in city centers. For example, up to a 40% reduction in NO2levels has been reported on car free days. These reductions are likely to lead to a reduction in premature mortality and morbidity. Furthermore the reduction in the number of cars, and therefore a reduction in the need for parking places and road space, provides opportunities to increase green space and green networks in cities, which in turn can lead to many beneficial health effects. All these measures are likely to lead to higher levels of active mobility and physical activity which may improve public health the most and also provide more opportunities for people to interact with each other in public space. Furthermore, such initiatives, if undertaken at a sufficiently large scale can result in positive distal effects and climate change mitigation through CO2reductions. The potential negative effects which may arise due to motorized traffic detouring around car free zone into their destinations also need further evaluation and the areas in which car free zones are introduced need to be given sufficient attention so as not to become an additional way to exacerbate socioeconomic divides. The extent and magnitude of all the above effects is still unclear and needs further research, including full chain health impact assessment modeling to quantify the potential health benefits of such schemes, and exposure and epidemiological studies to measure any changes when such interventions take place. Conclusions: The introduction of private car free cities is likely to have direct and indirect health benefits, but the exact magnitude and potential conflicting effects are as yet unclear. This paper has overviewed the expected health impacts, which can be useful to underpin policies to reduce car use in cities.},

To enhance the sample diversity in the memory, we propose a novel memory management strategy based on per-sample classification uncertainty and data augmentation, named Rainbow Memory (RM). With extensive empirical validations on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets, we show that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in blurry continual learning setups, outperforming state of the arts by large margins despite its simplicity.

In this paper, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimized is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.},

abstract = {The intertwined processes of learning and evolution in complex environmental niches have resulted in a remarkable diversity of morphological forms. Moreover, many aspects of animal intelligence are deeply embodied in these evolved morphologies. However, the principles governing relations between environmental complexity, evolved morphology, and the learnability of intelligent control, remain elusive, partially due to the substantial challenge of performing large-scale in silico experiments on evolution and learning. We introduce Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL): a novel computational framework which can evolve diverse agent morphologies to learn challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks in complex environments using only low level egocentric sensory information. Leveraging DERL we demonstrate several relations between environmental complexity, morphological intelligence and the learnability of control. First, environmental complexity fosters the evolution of morphological intelligence as quantified by the ability of a morphology to facilitate the learning of novel tasks. Second, evolution rapidly selects morphologies that learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late in the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the lifetime of their descendants. In agents that learn and evolve in complex environments, this result constitutes the first demonstration of a long-conjectured morphological Baldwin effect. Third, our experiments suggest a mechanistic basis for both the Baldwin effect and the emergence of morphological intelligence through the evolution of morphologies that are more physically stable and energy efficient, and can therefore facilitate learning and control.},

The plans outline the major barriers to achieving those goals and recommends activities to capitalize on the incentives and overcome the market barriers. The paper also presents possible future hydrogen energy-utilization patterns for better environment and sustainable development, and shows how the principles of thermodynamics via energy can be beneficially used to evaluate hydrogen and fuel cell systems and their role in sustainability.

Compared to conventional single-label classification problem, multi-label recognition problems are often more challenging due to two significant issues, namely the co-occurrence of labels and the dominance of negative labels (when treated as multiple binary classification problems). The Distribution-Balanced Loss tackles these issues through two key modifications to the standard binary cross-entropy loss: 1) a new way to re-balance the weights that takes into account the impact caused by label co-occurrence, and 2) a negative tolerant regularization to mitigate the over-suppression of negative labels. Experiments on both Pascal VOC and COCO show that the models trained with this new loss function achieve significant performance gains over existing methods.

We propose that progress in consciousness science will best be achieved by elaborating systematic mappings between physical and biological mechanisms, and the functional and (crucially) phenomenological properties of consciousness. This means we need theories for consciousness science, perhaps more so than theories of consciousness. From this perspective, âpredictive processing' emerges as a highly promising candidate.},

Indeed, one of the most influential theories in psychology, Prospect Theory, implicitly assumes that feelings govern choice. Surprisingly, however, we know very little about the rules by which feelings are transformed into decisions. Here, we characterize a computational model that uses feelings to predict choice. We reveal that this model predicts choice better than existing value-based models, showing a unique contribution of feelings to decisions, over and above value. Similar to Prospect Theory value function, feelings showed diminished sensitivity to outcomes as value increased. However, loss aversion in choice was explained by an asymmetry in how feelings about losses and gains were weighed when making a decision, not by an asymmetry in the feelings themselves. The results provide new insights into how feelings are utilized to reach a decision.},

abstract = {Deep learning models are increasingly popular in many machine learning applications where the training data may contain sensitive information. To provide formal and rigorous privacy guarantee, many learning systems now incorporate differential privacy by training their models with (differentially) private SGD. A key step in each private SGD update is gradient clipping that shrinks the gradient of an individual example whenever its `2 norm exceeds some threshold. We first demonstrate how gradient clipping can prevent SGD from converging to stationary point. We then provide a theoretical analysis that fully quantifies the clipping bias on convergence with a disparity measure between the gradient distribution and a geometrically symmetric distribution. Our empirical evaluation further suggests that the gradient distributions along the trajectory of private SGD indeed exhibit symmetric structure that favors convergence. Together, our results provide an explanation why private SGD with gradient clipping remains effective in practice despite its potential clipping bias. Finally, we develop a new perturbation-based technique that can provably correct the clipping bias even for instances with highly asymmetric gradient distributions.},

abstract = {Hydrogen bleeding into the cathode inlet of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell could be a simple approach to reduce the H 2 concentration in the fuel cell exhaust during transient operating conditions (e.g., start-up or fast transients) of a PEM fuel cell system; it could also serve as an additional heating source during cold start-up. In this experimental study, we address the question whether the chemical stability of the polymer electrolyte membrane is affected negatively by a hydrogen bleed into the cathode inlet of a PEM fuel cell. First, rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) experiments were carried out to detect whether any additional H 2 O 2 is produced during the oxygen reduction reaction in O 2 saturated electrolytes in the absence and presence of H 2 . Dry open circuit voltage (OCV) experiments were then performed for more than 250 hours in 50 cm 2 single cells at 120 â¢ C and 18% relative humidity (RH) in order to investigate the effect of a 4 vol. % H 2 -bleed into the cathode inlet on membrane stability. Finally, the distribution of membrane pin-holes was determined on membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) after the dry OCV tests conducted with or without H 2 -bleed using an infrared (IR) camera setup. In addition, the diffusion-limited hydrogen oxidation current on the cathode side was modeled in order to estimate the maximum areal heat flux near the cathode inlet, which would be caused if the H 2 oxidation rate were to be diffusion-limited.},

abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting means that a trained neural network model gradually forgets the previously learned tasks when retrained on new tasks. Overcoming the forgetting problem is a major problem in machine learning. Numerous continual learning algorithms are very successful in incremental classification tasks, where new labels appear frequently. However, there is currently no research that addresses the catastrophic forgetting problem in regression tasks as far as we know. This problem has emerged as one of the primary constraints in some applications, such as renewable energy forecasts. This article clarifies the problem-related definitions and proposes a new methodological framework that can forecast regression task targets and update itself by continual learning. The framework consists of forecasting neural networks and buffers, which store newly collected data from a data stream in an application. Changes in the probability distribution of the data stream will be identified by the framework and learned sequentially. The framework is called CLeaR (Continual Learning for Regression Tasks), where components can be flexibly customized for a specific application scenario. We design two sets of experiments to evaluate the CLeaR framework concerning fitting error (training), prediction error (test), and forgetting ratio. The first one is based on an artificial time series to explore how hyperparameters affect the CLeaR framework. The second one is designed with data collected from European wind farms to evaluate the performance of the CLeaR framework in a real-world application. The experimental results demonstrate that the CLeaR framework can efficiently accumulate knowledge in the data stream and improve the prediction accuracy. The article concludes with further research issues arising from requirements to extend the framework.},

Although conditional variations of deep generative models permit multiple distributions to be modeled by a single network in a disentangled fashion, they are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting when the distributions are encountered sequentially.

abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks.

The energy management implements a fuzzy logic-based system that allows it to adapt to ambient temperature and sunlight intensity in deployment location. Fuzzy energy management sets device's functional mode that affects the measurement rate of the weather station and subsequent storage rate in SD Card.

There are several technical challenges to this, such as occlusions, lack of calibration data and the scale ambiguity between object size and distance. These have not been addressed in full generality in previous work. Here we propose to tackle these issues by building upon advances in object recognition and using recently created large-scale datasets. We first introduce the task of amodal bounding box completion, which aims to infer the the full extent of the object instances in the image. We then propose a probabilistic framework for learning category-specific object size distributions from available annotations and leverage these in conjunction with amodal completions to infer veridical sizes of objects in novel images. Finally, we introduce a focal length prediction approach that exploits scene recognition to overcome inherent scale ambiguities and demonstrate qualitative results on challenging real-world scenes.},

Distilled Replay builds the buffer through a distillation process which compresses a large dataset into a tiny set of informative examples.

This approach can be treated as the new proposition for data pre-processing techniques. The influence of various types of input data pre-processing on the accuracy of neural network results is discussed by using numerical examples for the cases of natural frequency predictions of horizontal vibrations of load-bearing walls. It is concluded that a significant reduction in the neural network prediction errors is possible by conducting the appropriate input data transformation.},

Instead of declaring the nonlinearity of a learning system by neurons, we impose specialized nonlinearities on the network connections. The obtained models realize dynamical systems with varying (i.e., liquid) time-constants coupled to their hidden state, and outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers. These neural networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity within the family of neural ordinary differential equations, and give rise to improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To demonstrate these properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find bounds over their dynamics, and compute their expressive power by the trajectory length measure in a latent trajectory representation space. We then conduct a series of time-series prediction experiments to manifest the approximation capability of Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) compared to classical and modern RNNs.1},

In this work, we show how to reduce the redundancy in these parameters using a sparse decomposition. Maximum sparsity is obtained by exploiting both inter-channel and intra-channel redundancy, with a fine-tuning step that minimize the recognition loss caused by maximizing sparsity. This procedure zeros out more than 90% of parameters, with a drop of accuracy that is less than 1% on the ILSVRC2012 dataset. We also propose an efficient sparse matrix multiplication algorithm on CPU for Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNN) models. Our CPU implementation demonstrates much higher efficiency than the off-the-shelf sparse matrix libraries, with a significant speedup realized over the original dense network. In addition, we apply the SCNN model to the object detection problem, in conjunction with a cascade model and sparse fully connected layers, to achieve significant speedups.},

abstract = {Different from the traditional classification tasks which assume mutual exclusion of labels, hierarchical multi-label classification (HMLC) aims to assign multiple labels to every instance with the labels organized under hierarchical relations. Besides the labels, since linguistic ontologies are intrinsic hierarchies, the conceptual relations between words can also form hierarchical structures. Thus it can be a challenge to learn mappings from word hierarchies to label hierarchies. We propose to model the word and label hierarchies by embedding them jointly in the hyperbolic space. The main reason is that the tree-likeness of the hyperbolic space matches the complexity of symbolic data with hierarchical structures. A new Hyperbolic Interaction Model (HyperIM) is designed to learn the label-aware document representations and make predictions for HMLC. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets. The results have demonstrated that the new model can realistically capture the complex data structures and further improve the performance for HMLC comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. To facilitate future research, our code is publicly available.},

Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of N times, where N is the number of layers.

To simultaneously address both problems, we propose Meta Module Generation (MetaMG), a meta-learning method that enables a module generator to rapidly generate a category module from a few examples for a scalable classification network to recognize a new category. The old categories are not forgotten after new categories are added in. Comprehensive experiments conducted on 4 datasets show that our method is promising for fast incremental learning in few-shot setting. Further experiments on the miniImageNet dataset show that even it is not specially designed for the N-wayK-shot learning problem, MetaMG can sitll perform relatively well especially for 20-way K-shot setting.},

The possibility to a wide data collection from industrial processes makes possible to act smart action related to the system changes. Cyber-Physical Systems monitor physical processes and make possible decentralized decisions or even, in the last stage, a self-smart system adaptation. Thanks to the connectivity of the different production resources (machines, work stations, etc.) it is possible to generate information, to share and provide it and finally to create a smart system in which a predictive and automated decision making process with potential self-reconfiguration of the production system is possible to occur. As consequence Industry 4.0 could strongly impact on the actual assembly paradigms, even in the cases in which the human factor is prevailing, as manual assembly. This paper aims to investigate how these transformations are expected to occur. A future state map of the assembly paradigms as effect of the integration with the Industry 4.0 principles is presented. Moreover, a general architecture to implement Industry 4.0 principles into existing assembly systems is provided, highlighting how the final steps of implementation represented by the Operator Support Systems (OSS) and Self-Adapting Smart Assembly System (SASS) are crucial. A detailed report of a real case study derived by an Italian worldwide industrial refrigerator manufacturer represents a further element of interest of the research and demonstrates the practical implication of the study.},

abstract = {Conventional Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are known to be capable of providing multiple outputs for a single input, the variations in which can be utilised to detect Out of Distribution (OOD) inputs. BNNs are difficult to train due to their sensitivity towards the choice of priors. To alleviate this issue, we propose pseudo-BNNs where instead of learning distributions over weights, we use point estimates and perturb weights at the time of inference. We modify the cost function of conventional BNNs and use it to learn parameters for the purpose of injecting right amount of random perturbations to each of the weights of a neural network with point estimate. In order to effectively segregate OOD inputs from In Distribution (ID) inputs using multiple outputs, we further propose two measures, derived from the index of dispersion and entropy of probability distributions, and combine them with the proposed pseudo-BNNs. Overall, this combination results in a principled technique to detect OOD samples at the time of inference. We evaluate our technique on a wide variety of neural network architectures and image classification datasets. We observe that our method achieves state of the art results and beats the related previous work on various metrics such as FPR at 95% TPR, AUROC, AUPR and Detection Error by just using 2 to 5 samples of weights per input.},

abstract = {Object detection methods like Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) provide highly accurate object detection that run in real-time. However, these approaches require a large number of annotated training images. Evidently, not all of these images are equally useful for training the algorithms. Moreover, obtaining annotations in terms of bounding boxes for each image is costly and tedious. In this paper, we aim to obtain a highly accurate object detector using only a fraction of the training images. We do this by adopting active learning that uses 'human in the loop' paradigm to select the set of images that would be useful if annotated. Towards this goal, we make the following contributions: 1. We develop a novel active learning method which poses the layered architecture used in object detection as a 'query by committee' paradigm to choose the set of images to be queried. 2. We introduce a framework to use the exploration/exploitation trade-off in our methods. 3. We analyze the results on standard object detection datasets which show that with only a third of the training data, we can obtain more than 95% of the localization accuracy of full supervision. Further our methods outperform classical uncertainty-based active learning algorithms like maximum entropy.},

abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, populationbased genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance. We demonstrate the latter by showing that combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g. DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA is faster than ES, A3C, and DQN (it can train Atari in â¼4 hours on one desktop or â¼1 hour distributed on 720 cores), and enables a stateof-the-art, up to 10,000-fold compact encoding technique.},

Our measure distinguishes clearly between random labels and true labels on MNIST and CIFAR, as shown by experiments. Moreover, recent papers require sample complexity to increase (slowly) with the size, while our sample complexity is completely independent of the network size. (iii) Leamability of a broad class of smooth functions by 2-laycr ReLU nets trained via gradient descent.

The 3-dB analog modulation bandwidth of the TO-38-can packaged GaN blue LD biased at 65 mA and controlled at 25 degrees C is only 900 MHz, which can be extended to 1.5 GHz for OFDM encoding after throughput intensity optimization. When delivering the 4-Gbps 16-QAM OFDM data within 1-GHz bandwidth, the error vector magnitude (EVM), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit-error-rate (BER) of the received data are observed as 8.4%, 22.4 dB and 3.5 x 10<sup>-8</sup>, respectively. By increasing the encoded bandwidth to 1.5 GHz, the TO-38-can packaged GaN blue LD enlarges its transmission capacity to 6 Gbps but degrades its transmitted BER to 1.7 x 10<sup>-3</sup>. The same transmission capacity of 6 Gbps can also be achieved with a BER of 1 x 10<sup>-6</sup> by encoding 64-QAM OFDM data within 1-GHz bandwidth. Using the 1.5-GHz full bandwidth of the TO-38-can packaged GaN blue LD provides the 64-QAM OFDM transmission up to 9 Gbps, which successfully delivers data with an EVM of 5.1%, an SNR of 22 dB and a BER of 3.6 x 10<sup>-3</sup> passed the forward error correction (FEC) criterion.},

abstract = {We propose a general, yet simple patch that can be applied to existing regularization-based continual learning methods called classifier-projection regularization (CPR). Inspired by both recent results on neural networks with wide local minima and information theory, CPR adds an additional regularization term that maximizes the entropy of a classifier's output probability. We demonstrate that this additional term can be interpreted as a projection of the conditional probability given by a classifier's output to the uniform distribution. By applying the Pythagorean theorem for KL divergence, we then prove that this projection may (in theory) improve the performance of continual learning methods. In our extensive experimental results, we apply CPR to several state-of-the-art regularization-based continual learning methods and benchmark performance on popular image recognition datasets. Our results demonstrate that CPR indeed promotes a wide local minima and significantly improves both accuracy and plasticity while simultaneously mitigating the catastrophic forgetting of baseline continual learning methods.},

The recently introduced batch ensembles provide a drop-in replacement that is more parameter efficient. In this paper, we design ensembles not only over weights, but over hyperparameters to improve the state of the art in both settings. For best performance independent of budget, we propose hyper-deep ensembles, a simple procedure that involves a random search over different hyperparameters, themselves stratified across multiple random initializations. Its strong performance highlights the benefit of combining models with both weight and hyperparameter diversity. We further propose a parameter efficient version, hyper-batch ensembles, which builds on the layer structure of batch ensembles and self-tuning networks. The computational and memory costs of our method are notably lower than typical ensembles. On image classification tasks, with MLP, LeNet, and Wide ResNet 28-10 architectures, our methodology improves upon both deep and batch ensembles.},

The proposed approach leverages Transformer decoders to query the existence of a class label. The use of Transformer is rooted in the need of extracting local discriminative features adaptively for different labels, which is a strongly desired property due to the existence of multiple objects in one image. The built-in cross-attention module in the Transformer decoder offers an effective way to use label embeddings as queries to probe and pool class-related features from a feature map computed by a vision backbone for subsequent binary classifications. Compared with prior works, the new framework is simple, using standard Transformers and vision backbones, and effective, consistently outperforming all previous works on five multi-label classification data sets, including MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, and Visual Genome. Particularly, we establish $91.3\%$ mAP on MS-COCO. We hope its compact structure, simple implementation, and superior performance serve as a strong baseline for multi-label classification tasks and future studies.

abstract = {Model pruning seeks to induce sparsity in a deep neural network's various connection matrices, thereby reducing the number of nonzero-valued parameters in the model. Recent reports (Han et al., 2015a; Narang et al., 2017) prune deep networks at the cost of only a marginal loss in accuracy and achieve a sizable reduction in model size. This hints at the possibility that the baseline models in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number of hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure, exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efficient inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts with identical memory footprint. Across a broad range of neural network architectures (deep CNNs, stacked LSTM, and seq2seq LSTM models), we find large-sparse models to consistently outperform small-dense models and achieve up to 10x reduction in number of non-zero parameters with minimal loss in accuracy.},

abstract = {âLearning low-dimensional topological representation of a network in dynamic environments is attracting much attention due to the time-evolving nature of many real-world networks. The main and common objective of Dynamic Network Embedding (DNE) is to efficiently update node embeddings while preserving network topology at each time step. The idea of most existing DNE methods is to capture the topological changes at or around the most affected nodes (instead of all nodes) and accordingly update node embeddings. Unfortunately, this kind of approximation, although can improve efficiency, cannot effectively preserve the global topology of a dynamic network at each time step, due to not considering the inactive sub-networks that receive accumulated topological changes propagated via the high-order proximity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel node selecting strategy to diversely select the representative nodes over a network, which is coordinated with a new incremental learning paradigm of Skip-Gram based embedding approach. The extensive experiments show GloDyNE, with a small fraction of nodes being selected, can already achieve the superior or comparable performance w.r.t. the state-of-the-art DNE methods in three typical downstream tasks. Particularly, GloDyNE significantly outperforms other methods in the graph reconstruction task, which demonstrates its ability of global topology preservation.},

In general, if the effect of missing data is not taken into account the results of the statistical analyses will be biased and the amount of variability in the data will not be correctly estimated. There are three main types of missing data pattern: Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR) and Not Missing At Random (NMAR). The type of missing data that a researcher has in their dataset determines the appropriate method to use in handling the missing data before a formal statistical analysis begins. The aim of this practice note is to describe these patterns of missing data and how they can occur, as well describing the methods of handling them. Simple and more complex methods are described, including the advantages and disadvantages of each method as well as their availability in routine software.

Existing approaches to the problem rely on complex model architectures and training procedures that are difficult to tune and re-use. In this paper, we present an extremely simple approach that enables the use of ordinary logistic regression classifiers for few-shot incremental learning. The key to this approach is a new family of subspace regularization schemes that encourage weight vectors for new classes to lie close to the subspace spanned by the weights of existing classes. When combined with pretrained convolutional feature extractors, logistic regression models trained with subspace regularization outperform specialized, state-of-the-art approaches to few-shot incremental image classification by up to 22% on the miniImageNet dataset. Because of its simplicity, subspace regularization can be straightforwardly extended to incorporate additional background information about the new classes (including class names and descriptions specified in natural language); these further improve accuracy by up to 2%. Our results show that simple geometric regularization of class representations offers an effective tool for continual learning.},

The harmony search (HS) algorithm is used to determine the near-global optimal initial weights in the training of the model. The stratified sampling is used to sample the training data. A total of 25 HS-ANN hybrid models are tested with different combinations of HS algorithm parameters. The HS-ANN models are compared with the conventional ANN model, which uses a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the initial weights. Each model is run 50 times and the statistical analyses are conducted for the model results. The present models using stratified sampling are shown to be more accurate than those of previous studies. The statistical analyses for the model results show that the HS-ANN model with proper values of HS algorithm parameters can give much better and more stable prediction than the conventional ANN model.},

abstract = {In the context of learning to map an input $I$ to a function $h_I:\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}$, two alternative methods are compared: (i) an embedding-based method, which learns a fixed function in which $I$ is encoded as a conditioning signal $e(I)$ and the learned function takes the form $h_I(x) = q(x,e(I))$, and (ii) hypernetworks, in which the weights $\theta_I$ of the function $h_I(x) = g(x;\theta_I)$ are given by a hypernetwork $f$ as $\theta_I=f(I)$. In this paper, we define the property of modularity as the ability to effectively learn a different function for each input instance $I$. For this purpose, we adopt an expressivity perspective of this property and extend the theory of Devore et al. 1996 and provide a lower bound on the complexity (number of trainable parameters) of neural networks as function approximators, by eliminating the requirements for the approximation method to be robust. Our results are then used to compare the complexities of $q$ and $g$, showing that under certain conditions and when letting the functions $e$ and $f$ be as large as we wish, $g$ can be smaller than $q$ by orders of magnitude. This sheds light on the modularity of hypernetworks in comparison with the embedding-based method. Besides, we show that for a structured target function, the overall number of trainable parameters in a hypernetwork is smaller by orders of magnitude than the number of trainable parameters of a standard neural network and an embedding method.},

abstract = {Runoff prediction still represents an extremely important issue in applied hydrology. On the other hand, rainfall is one of the most complicated effective hydrologic processes in runoff prediction. For a developing country such as Malaysia which is prone to flood disaster having such an expert model for runoff forecasting is a very vital matter. In this article, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model is proposed to forecast the rainfall for Klang River in Malaysia on monthly basis. To be able to train and test the ANFIS and ANN models, the statistical data from 1997 to 2008, was obtained from Klang gates dam data. The optimum structure and optimum input pattern of model was determined through trial and error. Different combinations of rainfall were produced as inputs and five different criteria were used in order to evaluate the effectiveness of each network and its ability to make precise prediction. The performance of the ANFIS model is compared to artificial neural network (ANN) model. The five criteria are root mean square error (RMSE), Correlation Coefficient (2R;), and Nash Sutcliffe coefficient (NE), gamma coefficient (GC) Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC). The result indicate that the ANFIS model showed higher rainfall forecasting accuracy and low error compared to the ANN model. Furthermore, the rainfall estimated by this technique was closer to actual data than the other one. {\textcopyright}2011 Academic Journals.},

abstract = {Previous research into emotion and time perception has been designed to study the time perception of emotional events themselves (e.g., facial expression). Our aim was to investigate the effect of emotions per se on the subsequent time judgment of a neutral, non-affective event. In the present study, the participants were presented with films inducing a specific mood and were subsequently given a temporal bisection task. More precisely, the participants were given two temporal bisection tasks, one before and the other after viewing the emotional film. Three emotional films were tested: one eliciting fear, another sadness, and a neutral control film. In addition, the direct mood experience was assessed using the Brief Mood Introspective Scale that was administered to the participants at the beginning and the end of the session. The results showed that the perception of time did not change after viewing either the neutral control films or the sad films although the participants reported being sadder and less aroused after than before watching the sad film clips. In contrast, the stimulus durations were judged longer after than before viewing the frightening films that were judged to increase the emotion of fear and arousal level. In combination with findings from previous studies, our data suggest that the selective lengthening effect after watching frightening films was mediated by an effect of arousal on the speed of the internal clock system.},

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.},

We examined how socially induced memory errors are generated in the brain by studying the memory of individuals exposed to recollections of others. Participants exhibited a strong tendency to conform to erroneous recollections of the group, producing both long-lasting and temporary errors, even when their initial memory was strong and accurate. Functional brain imaging revealed that social influence modified the neuronal representation of memory. Specifically, a particular brain signature of enhanced amygdala activity and enhanced amygdala-hippocampus connectivity predicted long-lasting but not temporary memory alterations. Our findings reveal how social manipulation can alter memory and extend the known functions of the amygdala to encompass socially mediated memory distortions.},

In this paper we focus on scheduling for container transfers and encode the problem using a two-part chromosome approach which is then solved using a modified genetic algorithm. In simulation experiments, the performance of the GA-based approach and a sequential job scheduling method are evaluated and compared with different scheduling scenarios. The experimental results show that the GA-based approach can find better solutions which improve the overall performance. The GA-based approach has been implemented in the terminal scheduling system and the live testing results show that the GA-based approach can reduce the overall time-related cost of container transfers at the automated container terminal.

@inproceedings{Amari2020,
abstract = {While second order optimizers such as natural gradient descent (NGD) often speed up optimization, their effect on generalization remains controversial. For instance, it has been pointed out that gradient descent (GD), in contrast to many preconditioned updates, converges to small Euclidean norm solutions in overparameterized models, leading to favorable generalization properties. This work presents a more nuanced view on the comparison of generalization between first- and second-order methods. We provide an exact asymptotic bias-variance decomposition of the generalization error of overparameterized ridgeless regression under a general class of preconditioner P, and consider the inverse population Fisher information matrix (used in NGD) as a particular example. We determine the optimal P for both the bias and variance, and find that the relative generalization performance of different optimizers depends on the label noise and the âshapeâ of the signal (true parameters): when the labels are noisy, the model is misspecified, or the signal is misaligned with the features, NGD can achieve lower risk; conversely, GD generalizes better than NGD under clean labels, a well-specified model, or aligned signal. Based on this analysis, we discuss several approaches to manage the bias-variance tradeoff, and the potential benefit of interpolating between GD and NGD. We then extend our analysis to regression in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and demonstrate that preconditioned GD can decrease the population risk faster than GD. Lastly, we empirically compare the generalization performance of first- and second-order optimizers in neural network experiments, and observe robust trends matching our theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {Given new tasks with very little dataâsuch as new classes in a classification problem or a domain shift in the inputâperformance of modern vision systems degrades remarkably quickly. In this work, we illustrate how the neural network representations which underpin modern vision systems are subject to supervision collapse, whereby they lose any information that is not necessary for performing the training task, including information that may be necessary for transfer to new tasks or domains. We then propose two methods to mitigate this problem. First, we employ self-supervised learning to encourage general-purpose features that transfer better. Second, we propose a novel Transformer based neural network architecture called CrossTransformers, which can take a small number of labeled images and an unlabeled query, find coarse spatial correspondence between the query and the labeled images, and then infer class membership by computing distances between spatially-corresponding features. The result is a classifier that is more robust to task and domain shift, which we demonstrate via state-of-the-art performance on Meta-Dataset, a recent dataset for evaluating transfer from ImageNet to many other vision datasets.},

This paper aims to introduce a new approach to MCDA problems defined under fuzzy contexts that implements the concept of acceptability analysis, Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Acceptability Analysis (FMAA), based on the Fuzzy Rank Acceptability Analysis (FRAA), that provides a ranking and a confidence degree about the ranking of fuzzy quantities.

That being said, the field has still to frame a suite of benchmarks for the highly desirable setting of continual few-shot learning, where the learner is presented a number of few-shot tasks, one after the other, and then asked to perform well on a validation set stemming from all previously seen tasks. Continual few-shot learning has a small computational footprint and is thus an excellent setting for efficient investigation and experimentation. In this paper we first define a theoretical framework for continual few-shot learning, taking into account recent literature, then we propose a range of flexible benchmarks that unify the evaluation criteria and allows exploring the problem from multiple perspectives. As part of the benchmark, we introduce a compact variant of ImageNet, called SlimageNet64, which retains all original 1000 classes but only contains 200 instances of each one (a total of 200K data-points) downscaled to 64 x 64 pixels. We provide baselines for the proposed benchmarks using a number of popular few-shot learning algorithms, as a result, exposing previously unknown strengths and weaknesses of those algorithms in continual and data-limited settings.},

abstract = {In the image domain, excellent representations can be learned by inducing invariance to content-preserving transformations via noise contrastive learning. In this paper, we generalize contrastive learning to a wider set of transformations , and their compositions, for which either invariance or distinctiveness is sought. We show that it is not immediately obvious how existing methods such as SimCLR can be extended to do so. Instead, we introduce a number of formal requirements that all contrastive formulations must satisfy, and propose a practical construction which satisfies these requirements. In order to maximise the reach of this analysis, we express all components of noise contrastive formulations as the choice of certain generalized transformations of the data (GDTs), including data sampling. We then consider videos as an example of data in which a large variety of transformations are applicable, accounting for the extra modalities-for which we analyze audio and text-and the dimension of time. We find that being invariant to certain transformations and distinctive to others is critical to learning effective video representations, improving the state-of-the-art for multiple benchmarks by a large margin , and even surpassing supervised pretraining.

abstract = {Lifelong learning with deep neural networks is well-known to suffer from catastrophic forgetting: The performance on previous tasks drastically degrades when learning a new task. To alleviate this effect, we propose to leverage a large stream of unlabeled data easily obtainable in the wild. In particular, we design a novel class-incremental learning scheme with (a) a new distillation loss, termed global distillation, (b) a learning strategy to avoid overfitting to the most recent task, and (c) a confidence-based sampling method to effectively leverage unlabeled external data. Our experimental results on various datasets, including CIFAR and ImageNet, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over prior methods, particularly when a stream of unlabeled data is accessible: Our method shows up to 15.8% higher accuracy and 46.5% less forgetting compared to the state-of-the-art method.

First, as the formulation stage, we consider reliability and robustness simultaneously to propose the new formulation of reliability-based robust design optimization (RBRDO) problems. In order to generate reliable and robust Pareto-optimal solutions, the combination of genetic algorithm with reliability assessment loop based on the performance measure approach is applied as the second stage. Next, we develop two criteria to select a solution from obtained Pareto-optimal set to achieve the best possible implementation. Finally, the result verification is performed with Monte Carlo Simulations and also the quality improvement during manufacturing process is considered by identifying and controlling the critical variables. The effectiveness and applicability of this new proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Despite significant accuracy improvement in convolutional neural networks (CNN) based object detectors, they often require prohibitive runtimes to process an image for real-time applications. State-of-the-art models often use very deep networks with a large number of floating point operations. Efforts such as model compression learn compact models with fewer number of parameters, but with much reduced accuracy. In this work, we propose a new framework to learn compact and fast object detection networks with improved accuracy using knowledge distillation [20] and hint learning [34]. Although knowledge distillation has demonstrated excellent improvements for simpler classification setups, the complexity of detection poses new challenges in the form of regression, region proposals and less voluminous labels. We address this through several innovations such as a weighted cross-entropy loss to address class imbalance, a teacher bounded loss to handle the regression component and adaptation layers to better learn from intermediate teacher distributions. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation with different distillation configurations over multiple datasets including PASCAL, KITTI, ILSVRC and MS-COCO. Our results show consistent improvement in accuracy-speed trade-offs for modern multi-class detection models.},

abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For $300\times 300$ input, SSD achieves 72.1% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for $500\times 500$ input, SSD achieves 75.1% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

When the unsurpassed model is obtained, it will be validated across real-time data that is delivered from type II buoyweather station measurement at the Madura Strait, Java Sea. The prediction results of learning and validation process indicate that the ANN-Hybrid predictor perform more accurate than the ANN-GA and ANN PSO on training and validation. However, the gap of RMSE on real-time test is relatively high compared to validation or training. It can be influenced by the different frequent of weather fluctuation between them.

We introduce "Fickle Teacher" which provides variable supervision signals to the student for the same input. We observe that the response variability from the teacher results in a significant generalization improvement in the student. We further propose "Soft-Randomization" as a novel technique for improving robustness to input variability in the student. This minimizes the dissimilarity between the student's distribution on noisy data with teacher's distribution on clean data. We show that soft-randomization, even with low noise intensity, improves the robustness significantly with minimal drop in generalization. Lastly, we propose a new technique, "Messy-collaboration", which introduces target variability, whereby student and/or teacher are trained with randomly corrupted labels. We find that supervision from a corrupted teacher improves the adversarial robustness of student significantly while preserving its generalization and natural robustness. Our extensive empirical results verify the effectiveness of adding constructive noise in the knowledge distillation framework for improving the generalization and robustness of the model.},

Until now surprisingly little attention has been focused on continual learning of recurrent models applied to problems like image captioning. In this paper we take a systematic look at continual learning of LSTM-based models for image captioning. We propose an attention-based approach that explicitly accommodates the transient nature of vocabularies in continual image captioning tasks â i.e. that task vocabularies are not disjoint. We call our method Recurrent Attention to Transient Tasks (RATT), and also show how to adapt continual learning approaches based on weight regularization and knowledge distillation to recurrent continual learning problems. We apply our approaches to incremental image captioning problem on two new continual learning benchmarks we define using the MS-COCO and Flickr30 datasets. Our results demonstrate that RATT is able to sequentially learn five captioning tasks while incurring no forgetting of previously learned ones.},

abstract = {We study continual learning in the large scale setting where tasks in the input sequence are not limited to classification, and the outputs can be of high dimension. Among multiple state-of-the-art methods, we found vanilla experience replay (ER) still very competitive in terms of both performance and scalability, despite its simplicity. However, a degraded performance is observed for ER with small memory. A further visualization of the feature space reveals that the intermediate representation undergoes a distributional drift. While existing methods usually replay only the input-output pairs, we hypothesize that their regularization effect is inadequate for complex deep models and diverse tasks with small replay buffer size. Following this observation, we propose to replay the activation of the intermediate layers in addition to the input-output pairs. Considering that saving raw activation maps can dramatically increase memory and compute cost, we propose the Compressed Activation Replay technique, where compressed representations of layer activation are saved to the replay buffer. We show that this approach can achieve superior regularization effect while adding negligible memory overhead to replay method. Experiments on both the large-scale Taskonomy benchmark with a diverse set of tasks and standard common datasets (Split-CIFAR and Split-miniImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In addition to influencing the perception of visual images, light coordinates the temporal rhythms of physiology and behaviour by sending signals to structures in the brain that contain the central circadian clock. These signals are mediated in part by melanopsin, a photopigment found in the retina. Light affects the brain through these nonvisual pathways, and scientists have recently begun to realize just how pervasive these nonvisual effects are. Mounting evidence supports the view that the effects of light on sleep and brain activity during wakefulness, as well as the duration of sleep and the homeostatic response to sleep loss, depend on both melanopsin and circadian time.},

To maximally excavate the capability of transformer, we present to utilize the well-known ImageNet benchmark for generating a large amount of corrupted image pairs.

To alleviate forgetting, we put forward to preserve the old class knowledge by maintaining the topology of the network's feature space. On this basis, we propose a novel topology-preserving class-incremental learning (TPCIL) framework. TPCIL uses an elastic Heb-bian graph (EHG) to model the feature space topology, which is constructed with the competitive Hebbian learning rule. To maintain the topology, we develop the topology-preserving loss (TPL) that penalizes the changes of EHG's neighboring relationships during incremental learning phases. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet, and subImageNet datasets demonstrate the power of the TPCIL for continuously learning new classes with less forgetting. The code will be released.},

For speech recognition system, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) becomes a popular feature extraction method but it has various weaknesses especially about the accuracy level and the high of result feature dimension of the extraction method. This paper presents the combination of MFCC feature extraction method with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve the accuracy in Indonesian speech recognition system. By combining MFCC and PCA, it was expected to increase the accuracy system and reduce the feature data dimension. The result of MFCC data features extraction added with delta coefficients formed matrix data that later would be reduced using PCA. PCA method in the process of data reduction was designed to be two versions. Then the result of PCA reduction data was processed to the classification process using K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) method. Composing the data was formed from 140 speech data that were recorded from 28 speakers. The research findings showed that adding PCA method version 1 could reduce the feature dimension from 26 to 12 by the same accuracy of speech recognition with the conventional MFCC method without PCA, that is 86.43%. Whereas PCA method version 2 could increase the accuracy of speech recognition from the conventional MFCC method without PCA in increasing from 86.43% to 89.29% and decreasing of the data dimension from 26 to 10 feature dimensions.},

abstract = {Solid oxide fuel cells are a promising option for distributed energy stationary power generation that offers efficiencies up to 50 in stand-alone applications, 70 in hybrid gas turbine applications and 80 in cogeneration. To advance SOFC technology sufficiently for widespread market penetration, the SOFC must demonstrate improved cell lifetime from the status quo. Much research has been performed to improve SOFC lifetime using advanced geometries and materials, and in this research, we suggest further improving lifetime by designing an advanced control algorithm based upon preexisting mechanical stress analysis [1]. Control algorithms commonly address SOFC lifetime related operability objectives using unconstrained, SISO control algorithms that seek to minimize thermal transients. While thermal fatigue may be one thermal stress driver, these studies often do not consider maximum radial thermal gradients or critical absolute temperatures in the SOFC. In addition, researchers often discuss hot-spots as a critical lifetime reliability issue, but as previous stress work demonstrates, the minimum cell temperature is the primary thermal stress driver in tubular SOFCs modeled after the Siemens Power Generation, Inc. design. In this work, we present a dynamic, quasi-two-dimensional model for a high-temperature tubular SOFC combined with ejector and prereformer models. The model captures dynamics of critical thermal stress drivers and is used as the physical plant for closed-loop simulations with a constrained, MIMO model predictive control algorithm. Closed-loop simulation results demonstrate effective load-following, operability constraint satisfaction, and disturbance rejection. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Continual learning from a sequential stream of data is a crucial challenge for machine learning research. Most studies have been conducted on this topic under the single-label classification setting along with an assumption of balanced label distribution. This work expands this research horizon towards multi-label classification. In doing so, we identify unanticipated adversity innately existent in many multi-label datasets, the long-tailed distribution. We jointly address the two independently solved problems, Catastropic Forgetting and the long-tailed label distribution by first empirically showing a new challenge of destructive forgetting of the minority concepts on the tail. Then, we curate two benchmark datasets, COCOseq and NUS-WIDEseq, that allow the study of both intra- and inter-task imbalances. Lastly, we propose a new sampling strategy for replay-based approach named Partitioning Reservoir Sampling (PRS), which allows the model to maintain a balanced knowledge of both head and tail classes. We publicly release the dataset and the code in our project page.},

Few-shot learning is widely used as one of the standard benchmarks in meta-learning. In this work, we show that a simple baseline: learning a supervised or self-supervised representation on the meta-training set, followed by training a linear classifier on top of this representation, outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods. An additional boost can be achieved through the use of self-distillation. This demonstrates that using a good learned embedding model can be more effective than sophisticated meta-learning algorithms. We believe that our findings motivate a rethinking of few-shot image classification benchmarks and the associated role of meta-learning algorithms.

We therefore present a systematic and extensive analysis of experience replay in Q-learning methods, focusing on two fundamental properties: the replay capacity and the ratio of learning updates to experience collected (replay ratio). Our additive and ablative studies upend conventional wisdom around experience replay â greater capacity is found to substantially increase the performance of certain algorithms, while leaving others unaffected. Counterintuitively we show that theoretically ungrounded, uncorrected n-step returns are uniquely beneficial while other techniques confer limited benefit for sifting through larger memory. Separately, by directly controlling the replay ratio we contextualize previous observations in the literature and empirically measure its importance across a variety of deep RL algorithms. Finally, we conclude by testing a set of hypotheses on the nature of these performance benefits.},

abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the predominant technique for learning over graphs. However, there is relatively little understanding of why GNNs are successful in practice and whether they are necessary for good performance. Here, we show that for many standard transductive node classification benchmarks, we can exceed or match the performance of state-of-the-art GNNs by combining shallow models that ignore the graph structure with two simple post-processing steps that exploit correlation in the label structure: (i) an "error correlation" that spreads residual errors in training data to correct errors in test data and (ii) a "prediction correlation" that smooths the predictions on the test data. We call this overall procedure Correct and Smooth (C&S), and the post-processing steps are implemented via simple modifications to standard label propagation techniques from early graph-based semi-supervised learning methods. Our approach exceeds or nearly matches the performance of state-of-the-art GNNs on a wide variety of benchmarks, with just a small fraction of the parameters and orders of magnitude faster runtime. For instance, we exceed the best known GNN performance on the OGB-Products dataset with 137 times fewer parameters and greater than 100 times less training time. The performance of our methods highlights how directly incorporating label information into the learning algorithm (as was done in traditional techniques) yields easy and substantial performance gains. We can also incorporate our techniques into big GNN models, providing modest gains. Our code for the OGB results is at https://github.com/Chillee/CorrectAndSmooth.},

abstract = {Suppose curb parking is free but all the spaces are occupied, and off-street parking is expensive but immediately available. In this case, you can cruise to find a curb space being vacated by a departing motorist, or pay for off-street parking right away. This paper presents a model of how drivers choose whether to cruise or to pay, and it predicts several results: you are more likely to cruise if curb parking is cheap, off-street parking is expensive, fuel is cheap, you want to park for a long time, you are alone in the car, and you place a low value on saving time. The model also predicts that charging the market price for curb parking-at least equal to the price of adjacent off-street parking-will eliminate cruising. Because the government sets curb parking prices, planners and elected officials strongly influence drivers' decisions to cruise. The failure to charge market rates for curb parking congests traffic, pollutes the air, wastes fuel, and causes accidents. Between 1927 and 2001, studies of cruising in congested downtowns have found that it took between 3.5 and 14 min to find a curb space, and that between 8 and 74 percent of the traffic was cruising for parking. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Incremental learning is useful if an AI agent needs to integrate data from a stream. The problem is non trivial if the agent runs on a limited computational budget and has a bounded memory of past data. In a deep learning approach, the constant computational budget requires the use of a fixed architecture for all incremental states. The bounded memory generates imbalance in favor of new classes and a prediction bias toward them appears. This bias is commonly countered by introducing a data balancing step in addition to the basic network training. We depart from this approach and propose simple but efficient scaling of past classifiers' weights to make them more comparable to those of new classes. Scaling exploits incremental state statistics and is applied to the classifiers learned in the initial state of classes to profit from all their available data. We also question the utility of the widely used distillation loss component of incremental learning algorithms by comparing it to vanilla fine tuning in presence of a bounded memory. Evaluation is done against competitive baselines using four public datasets. Results show that the classifier weights scaling and the removal of the distillation are both beneficial.},

abstract = {In this paper, we aim to improve the data efficiency of image captioning. We propose VisualGPT, a data-efficient image captioning model that leverages the linguistic knowledge from a large pretrained language model (LM). A crucial challenge is to balance between the use of visual information in the image and prior linguistic knowledge acquired from pretraining.We designed a novel self-resurrecting encoder-decoder attention mechanism to quickly adapt the pretrained LM as the language decoder on a small amount of in-domain training data. The pro-posed self-resurrecting activation unit produces sparse activations but is not susceptible to zero gradients. When trained on 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% of MSCOCO and Conceptual Captions, the proposed model, VisualGPT, surpasses strong image captioning baselines. VisualGPT outperforms the best baseline model by up to 10.8% CIDEr on MS COCO and up to 5.4% CIDEr on Conceptual Captions.We also perform a series of ablation studies to quantify the utility of each system component. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that improves data efficiency of image captioning by utilizing LM pretrained on unimodal data.

The storage services of cloud environment are replacing the traditional Content Delivery Networks for more reliability and easy availability of contents to users. Most research in Content Delivery Networks mainly focuses on delivering contents to the users with less latency and traffic cost. Apart from this the overall cost incurred for the content providers in cases of bandwidth and storage should also be taken into consideration. Most existing Content Delivery Networks focus only on the bandwidth and in some cases latency. In this paper a novel Content Delivery Model is proposed that makes use of a Genetic Optimization Algorithm (GOA) combined with an efficient storage model that can achieve better content placement and delivery in Cloud based Content Delivery Networks. The proposed approach updates itself dynamically to avoid unwanted use of storage that achieves a much better placement of contents thus reducing the storage cost.},

Due to time consumption, storage burden and privacy of old data, it is inadvisable to train the model from scratch with both old and new data when new object classes emerge after the model trained. In this paper, we propose a novel incremental object detector based on Faster R-CNN to continuously learn from new object classes without using old data. It is a triple network where an old model and a residual model as assistants for helping the incremental model learning on new classes without forgetting the previous learned knowledge. To better maintain the discrimination of features between old and new classes, the residual model is jointly trained on new classes in the incremental learning procedure. In addition, a corresponding distillation scheme is designed to guide the training process, which consists of a two-level residual distillation loss and a joint classification distillation loss. Extensive experiments on VOC2007 and COCO are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively learn to incrementally detect objects of new classes, and the problem of catastrophic forgetting is mitigated in this context.},

The analysis was carried out using time series data on the supply of fresh vegetables during the period from 2002 to 2011 which was collected from the office of the Deputy Directorate of Agri-business situated at Madurai, India. The analysis of monthly supply and price of vegetables data was used to find out seasonal pattern. The seasonal index for vegetable supply was highest in March and April and was lower in the November and December. The seasonal variation in vegetables price was high in the period of November to January and price low in March. It was further inferred that forecast value for the supply of fresh brinjal , Bhendi and Green Chilly was low in January'13 and it was high in December for these vegetables whereas in the forecasted value for the supply of fresh tomato and green chilly variations were found. The study suggested that cold storage capacities may be developed in the needy places to increase the benefits of consumers and farmers to increase the efficiency of Supply Chain Management.},

Over the past two decades, multitudinous fuzzy time series blueprints have been put forth for agricultural yield production. However, most of these predictions were based on 7th interval partitioning. A surprising insight was that nobody gave a sound reason to justify the choice of that particular interval. So, this paper focuses on predicting data values on a large spectrum of fuzzy logic computations based on second and third-degree relationships. This paper showcases work on 4 different types of the fuzzy interval, where each interval is tested with 4 degrees of regression equations. Each of these 16 cases is performed for the fuzzy logic relationship (FLR) 2 and 3 separately. Apart from this, the robustness of algorithm is a testament to an incredible solution for the time series model. In addition to this, A Regression analysis model has been enforced to accomplish the efficient defuzzification operation.

The architecture is a form of Memory Network [23] but unlike the model in that work, it is trained end-to-end, and hence requires significantly less supervision during training, making it more generally applicable in realistic settings. It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch [2] to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering [22] and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results.},

abstract = {Background The integration of digital treatments into national mental health services is on the agenda in the European Union. The E-COMPARED consortium conducted a survey aimed at exploring stakeholders' knowledge, acceptance and expectations of digital treatments for depression, and at identifying factors that might influence their opinions when considering the implementation of these approaches. Method An online survey was conducted in eight European countries: France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and The United Kingdom. Organisations representing government bodies, care providers, service-users, funding/insurance bodies, technical developers and researchers were invited to participate in the survey. The participating countries and organisations reflect the diversity in health care infrastructures and e-health implementation across Europe. Results A total of 764 organisations were invited to the survey during the period MarchâJune 2014, with 175 of these organisations participating in our survey. The participating stakeholders reported moderate knowledge of digital treatments and considered cost-effectiveness to be the primary incentive for integration into care services. Low feasibility of delivery within existing care services was considered to be a primary barrier. Digital treatments were regarded more suitable for milder forms of depression. Stakeholders showed greater acceptability towards blended treatment (the integration of face-to-face and internet sessions within the same treatment protocol) compared to standalone internet treatments. Organisations in countries with developed e-health solutions reported greater knowledge and acceptability of digital treatments. Conclusion Mental health stakeholders in Europe are aware of the potential benefits of digital interventions. However, there are variations between countries and stakeholders in terms of level of knowledge about such interventions and their feasibility within routine care services. The high acceptance of blended treatments is an interesting finding that indicates a gradual integration of technology into clinical practice may fit the attitudes and needs of stakeholders. The potential of the blended treatment approach, in terms of enhancing acceptance of digital treatment while retaining the benefit of cost-effectiveness in delivery, should be further explored. Funding The E-COMPARED project has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007â2013) under grant agreement no. 603098.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks experience catastrophic forgetting when optimized on a sequence of learning problems: as they meet the objective of the current training examples, their performance on previous tasks drops drastically. In this work, we introduce a novel framework to tackle this problem with conditional computation. We equip each convolutional layer with task-specific gating modules, selecting which filters to apply on the given input. This way, we achieve two appealing properties. Firstly, the execution patterns of the gates allow to identify and protect important filters, ensuring no loss in the performance of the model for previously learned tasks. Secondly, by using a sparsity objective, we can promote the selection of a limited set of kernels, allowing to retain sufficient model capacity to digest new tasks. Existing solutions require, at test time, awareness of the task to which each example belongs to. This knowledge, however, may not be available in many practical scenarios. Therefore, we additionally introduce a task classifier that predicts the task label of each example, to deal with settings in which a task oracle is not available. We validate our proposal on four continual learning datasets. Results show that our model consistently outperforms existing methods both in the presence and the absence of a task oracle. Notably, on Split SVHN and Imagenet-50 datasets, our model yields up to 23.98% and 17.42% improvement in accuracy w.r.t. competing methods.},

In this paper, we introduce pixel-level pretext tasks for learning dense feature representations. The first task directly applies contrastive learning at the pixel level. We additionally propose a pixel-to-propagation consistency task that produces better results, even surpassing the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. Specifically, it achieves 60.2 AP, 41.4 / 40.5 mAP and 77.2 mIoU when transferred to Pascal VOC object detection (C4), COCO object detection (FPN / C4) and Cityscapes semantic segmentation using a ResNet-50 backbone network, which are 2.6 AP, 0.8 / 1.0 mAP and 1.0 mIoU better than the previous best methods built on instance-level contrastive learning. Moreover, the pixel-level pretext tasks are found to be effective for pre-training not only regular backbone networks but also head networks used for dense downstream tasks, and are complementary to instance-level contrastive methods. These results demonstrate the strong potential of defining pretext tasks at the pixel level, and suggest a new path forward in unsupervised visual representation learning.},

abstract = {A longstanding goal in deep learning research has been to precisely characterize training and generalization. However, the often complex loss landscapes of neural networks (NNs) have made a theory of learning dynamics elusive. In this work, we show that for wide NNs the learning dynamics simplify considerably and that, in the infinite width limit, they are governed by a linear model obtained from the first-order Taylor expansion of the network around its initial parameters. Furthermore, mirroring the correspondence between wide Bayesian NNs and Gaussian processes (GPs), gradient-based training of wide NNs with a squared loss produces test set predictions drawn from a GP with a particular compositional kernel. While these theoretical results are only exact in the infinite width limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the predictions of the original network and those of the linearized version even for finite practically-sized networks. This agreement is robust across different architectures, optimization methods, and loss functions.},

The wind direction measured in the past minutes is used as input and the wind direction for the next two minutes constitutes the output. The two methods are based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM), respectively. For both methods we optimise the length of the moving average that we use to pre-process the input data, the length of the input vector and, for the ANN only, the number of neurons of each layer. The forecast is evaluated by looking at the mean absolute error and at a mean effectiveness index, which assesses the percentage of times that the forecast is accurate enough to predict the correct tactical choice in a sailing yacht race. The ANN forecast based on the ensemble average of ten networks shows a larger mean absolute error and a similar mean effectiveness index than the SVM forecast. However, we showed that the ANN forecast accuracy increases significantly with the size of the ensemble. Therefore increasing the computational power, it can lead to a better forecast.},

abstract = {Light pollution is one of the most rapidly increasing types of environmental degradation. Its levels have been growing exponentially over the natural nocturnal lighting levels provided by starlight and moonlight. To limit this pollution several effective practices have been defined: the use of shielding on lighting fixture to prevent direct upward light, particularly at low angles above the horizon; no over lighting, i.e. avoid using higher lighting levels than strictly needed for the task, constraining illumination to the area where it is needed and the time it will be used. Nevertheless, even after the best control of the light distribution is reached and when the proper quantity of light is used, some upward light emission remains, due to reflections from the lit surfaces and atmospheric scatter. The environmental impact of this "residual light pollution", cannot be neglected and should be limited too. Here we propose a new way to limit the effects of this residual light pollution on wildlife, human health and stellar visibility. We performed analysis of the spectra of common types of lamps for external use, including the new LEDs. We evaluated their emissions relative to the spectral response functions of human eye photoreceptors, in the photopic, scotopic and the 'meltopic' melatonin suppressing bands. We found that the amount of pollution is strongly dependent on the spectral characteristics of the lamps, with the more environmentally friendly lamps being low pressure sodium, followed by high pressure sodium. Most polluting are the lamps with a strong blue emission, like Metal Halide and white LEDs. Migration from the now widely used sodium lamps to white lamps (MH and LEDs) would produce an increase of pollution in the scotopic and melatonin suppression bands of more than five times the present levels, supposing the same photopic installed flux. This increase will exacerbate known and possible unknown effects of light pollution on human health, environment and on visual perception of the Universe by humans. We present quantitative criteria to evaluate the lamps based on their spectral emissions and we suggest regulatory limits for future lighting. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper we explore this further in the context of well-known positions on the production of science and scientific rationality. We inquire about the sources of epistemological self-confidenceâthe extent to which human factors is satisfied with its beliefs and assumptions about how it knows what it knows. We question whether a large body of evidence for a construct is evidence of strong science, or whether critical reflection and skepticism about this is actually what distinguishes scientific knowledge from folk models. We also review pre- sumptions of a-perspectival objectivity, in which researchers believe they are able to take a âview from nowhereâ and enjoy an objective window onto an existing reality. Weask whether human factors constructs don't so much reflect but rather create a particular empirical world, which would not even exist without those constructs. This article serves as an invitation to rethink what we mean by epistemological confidence and how we arrive at it.},

abstract = {In the present paper, we report on a method to retrieve the pigment concentration in Case I waters from ocean color. The method is derived from radiative transfer (RT) simulations and subsequent application of artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. Information on absorption and total scattering of pure seawater, colored dissolved organic matter, and marine particles are mostly taken from published measurements or parameterizations. Additionally, a new model relating the backscattering of marine particles to pigment concentration and wavelength is introduced. The such defined inherent optical properties are input to a RTcode in order to generate a synthetic data set of remote sensing reflectance spectra. This synthetic data set is then used for the training of a set of ANNs with the aim to approximate the functional relationship between ocean color and pigment concentration. The different ANNs are obtained by systematic variations of input parameters, architecture, and noise level added to the training data. The performance of each individual ANN-based pigment retrieval scheme is assessed by applying it to the remote sensing reflectance spectra contained in the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Bio-optical Algorithm MiniWorkshop (SeaBAM) data set and comparing the retrieved pigment concentrations to those actually measured. The most successful ANN compares favorably with commonly used empirical pigment retrieval schemes. Compared, e.g., to the SeaWiFS algorithms OC2B and OC4, the square of the correlation coefficient r2 is increased from 0.924 (OC2B), respectively, 0.928 (OC4) to 0.934 (ANN). The root mean square error of the retrieved log-transformed pigment concentration drops from 0.156 for OC2B, respectively, 0.151 for OC4 to 0.148 for the ANN-based pigment retrieval scheme. Furthermore, the latter shows a higher resistance against noisy input data. INDEX},

abstract = {Deep network architectures struggle to continually learn new tasks without forgetting the previous tasks. A recent trend indicates that dynamic architectures based on an expansion of the parameters can reduce catastrophic forgetting efficiently in continual learning. However, existing approaches often require a task identifier at test-time, need complex tuning to balance the growing number of parameters, and barely share any information across tasks. As a result, they struggle to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead. In this paper, we propose a transformer architecture based on a dedicated encoder/decoder framework. Critically, the encoder and decoder are shared among all tasks. Through a dynamic expansion of special tokens, we specialize each forward of our decoder network on a task distribution. Our strategy scales to a large number of tasks while having negligible memory and time overheads due to strict control of the parameters expansion. Moreover, this efficient strategy doesn't need any hyperparameter tuning to control the network's expansion. Our model reaches excellent results on CIFAR100 and state-of-the-art performances on the large-scale ImageNet100 and ImageNet1000 while having less parameters than concurrent dynamic frameworks.},

In this work we propose a new conceptualization of the continual learning problem in terms of a temporally symmetric trade-off between transfer and interference that can be optimized by enforcing gradient alignment across examples. We then propose a new algorithm, Meta-Experience Replay (MER), that directly exploits this view by combining experience replay with optimization based meta-learning. This method learns parameters that make interference based on future gradients less likely and transfer based on future gradients more likely. We conduct experiments across continual lifelong supervised learning benchmarks and non-stationary reinforcement learning environments demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms recently proposed baselines for continual learning. Our experiments show that the gap between the performance of MER and baseline algorithms grows both as the environment gets more non-stationary and as the fraction of the total experiences stored gets smaller.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel design of interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems (IT2FLS) by utilizing the theory of extreme learning machine (ELM) for electricity load demand forecasting. ELM has become a popular learning algorithm for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFN). From the functional equivalence between the SLFN and fuzzy inference system, a hybrid of fuzzy-ELM has gained attention of the researchers. This paper extends the concept of fuzzy-ELM to an IT2FLS based on ELM (IT2FELM). In the proposed design the antecedent membership function parameters of the IT2FLS are generated randomly, whereas the consequent part parameters are determined analytically by the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse. The ELM strategy ensures fast learning of the IT2FLS as well as optimality of the parameters. Effectiveness of the proposed design of IT2FLS is demonstrated with the application of forecasting nonlinear and chaotic data sets. Nonlinear data of electricity load from the Australian National Electricity Market for the Victoria region and from the Ontario Electricity Market are considered here. The proposed model is also applied to forecast Mackey-glass chaotic time series data. Comparative analysis of the proposed model is conducted with some traditional models such as neural networks (NN) and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). In order to verify the structure of the proposed design of IT2FLS an alternate design of IT2FLS based on Kalman filter (KF) is also utilized for the comparison purposes.},

abstract = {Humans and most animals can learn new tasks without forgetting old ones. However, training artificial neural networks (ANNs) on new tasks typically causes them to forget previously learned tasks. This phenomenon is the result of "catastrophic forgetting," in which training an ANN disrupts connection weights that were important for solving previous tasks, degrading task performance. Several recent studies have proposed methods to stabilize connection weights of ANNs that are deemed most important for solving a task, which helps alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Here, drawing inspiration from algorithms that are believed to be implemented in vivo, we propose a complementary method: Adding a context-dependent gating signal, such that only sparse, mostly nonoverlapping patterns of units are active for any one task. This method is easy to implement, requires little computational overhead, and allows ANNs to maintain high performance across large numbers of sequentially presented tasks, particularly when combined with weight stabilization. We show that this method works for both feedforward and recurrent network architectures, trained using either supervised or reinforcement-based learning. This suggests that using multiple, complementary methods, akin to what is believed to occur in the brain, can be a highly effective strategy to support continual learning.},

abstract = {When speakers talk, they gesture. The goal of this review is to investigate the contribution that these gestures make to how we communicate and think. Gesture can play a role in communication and thought at many timespans. We explore, in turn, gesture's contribution to how language is produced and understood in the moment; its contribution to how we learn language and other cognitive skills; and its contribution to how language is created over generations, over childhood, and on the spot. We find that the gestures speakers produce when they talk are integral to communication and can be harnessed in a number of ways. (a) Gesture reflects speakers' thoughts, often their unspoken thoughts, and thus can serve as a window onto cognition. Encouraging speakers to gesture can thus provide another route for teachers, clinicians, interviewers, etc., to better understand their communication partners. (b) Gesture can change speakers' thoughts. Encouraging gesture thus has the potential to change how students, patients, witnesses, etc., think about a problem and, as a result, alter the course of learning, therapy, or an interchange. (c) Gesture provides building blocks that can be used to construct a language. By watching how children and adults who do not already have a language put those blocks together, we can observe the process of language creation. Our hands are with us at all times and thus provide researchers and learners with an ever-present tool for understanding how we talk and think.},

abstract = {Building reliable object detectors that are robust to domain shifts, such as various changes in context, viewpoint, and object appearances, is critical for real-world applications. In this work, we study the effectiveness of auxiliary self-supervised tasks to improve the out-of-distribution generalization of object detectors. Inspired by the principle of maximum entropy, we introduce a novel self-supervised task, instance-level temporal cycle confusion (CycConf), which operates on the region features of the object detectors. For each object, the task is to find the most different object proposals in the adjacent frame in a video and then cycle back to itself for self-supervision. CycConf encourages the object detector to explore invariant structures across instances under various motions, which leads to improved model robustness in unseen domains at test time. We observe consistent out-of-domain performance improvements when training object detectors in tandem with self-supervised tasks on large-scale video datasets (BDD100K and Waymo open data). The joint training framework also establishes a new state-of-the-art on standard unsupervised domain adaptative detection benchmarks (Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, and Sim10K).

At the same time, we update the target network with a slow-moving average of the online network. While state-of-the art methods intrinsically rely on negative pairs, BYOL achieves a new state of the art without them. BYOL reaches 74.3% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet using the standard linear evaluation protocol with a ResNet-50 architecture and 79.6% with a larger ResNet.

abstract = {Context: Millions of individuals habitually expose themselves to room light in the hours before bedtime, yet the effects of this behavior on melatonin signaling are not well recognized. Objective:Wetested the hypothesis that exposure toroomlight in the late evening suppresses the onset of melatonin synthesis and shortens the duration of melatonin production. Design: In a retrospective analysis, we compared daily melatonin profiles in individuals living in room light (?200 lux) vs. dim light (?3 lux). Patients: Healthy volunteers (n ? 116, 18â30 yr) were recruited from the general population to participate in one of two studies. Setting: Participants lived in a General Clinical Research Center for at least five consecutive days. Intervention: Individuals were exposed to room light or dim light in the 8 h preceding bedtime. Outcome Measures: Melatonin duration, onset and offset, suppression, and phase angle of en- trainment were determined. Results: Compared with dim light, exposure to room light before bedtime suppressed melatonin, resulting in a later melatonin onset in 99.0% of individuals and shortening melatonin duration by about 90 min. Also, exposure to room light during the usual hours of sleep suppressed melatonin by greater than 50% in most (85%) trials. Conclusions:Thesefindingsindicatethatroomlightexertsaprofoundsuppressiveeffectonmelatonin levels and shortens the body's internal representation of night duration. Hence, chronically exposing oneself to electrical lighting in the late evening disrupts melatonin signaling and could therefore potentially impact sleep, thermoregulation, blood pressure, and glucose homeostasis.},

abstract = {Contrastive learning has been adopted as a core method for unsupervised visual representation learning. Without human annotation, the common practice is to perform an instance discrimination task: Given a query image crop, this task labels crops from the same image as positives, and crops from other randomly sampled images as negatives. An important limitation of this label assignment strategy is that it can not reflect the heterogeneous similarity between the query crop and each crop from other images, taking them as equally negative, while some of them may even belong to the same semantic class as the query. To address this issue, inspired by consistency regularization in semi-supervised learning on unlabeled data, we propose Consistent Contrast (CO2), which introduces a consistency regularization term into the current contrastive learning framework. Regarding the similarity of the query crop to each crop from other images as âunlabeledâ, the consistency term takes the corresponding similarity of a positive crop as a pseudo label, and encourages consistency between these two similarities. Empirically, CO2 improves Momentum Contrast (MoCo) by 2.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet linear protocol, 3.8% and 1.1% top-5 accuracy on 1% and 10% labeled semi-supervised settings. It also transfers to image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC. This shows that CO2 learns better visual representations for these downstream tasks.},

Experiments were carried out using a commercial bench stirred tank reactor of 2 dm3 volume, at 200 rpm, with a methanol to oil ratio 6 to 1 and 1 mas.% catalyst loading as constant parameters. Ester yields were followed as a function of temperature (60-120 ??C), pressure (1-15 bars) and reaction time (1.5-5.5 h). The temperature of 100 ??C was found to be optimal for the maximum (91%) conversion to methyl esters, while pressure had a positive impact up to 10 bars at 80 ??C. The catalyst activation in air leading to the formation of strong basic sites was found to occur at 900 ??C. Catalyst particle coalescence took place during the reaction, giving a gum-like structure, and resulted in a significant catalyst deactivation. The pseudo-first order reaction was established, with a "knee" at 80 ??C in the Arrhenius plot separating the kinetic and diffusion regimes. During the reaction progress, an activation energy decrease from 161 to 101 kJ/mol, and from 32 to (-3) kJ/mol, was found for the kinetic and diffusion regimes, respectively. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we perform soft theorem-proving by leveraging TLMs to generate natural language proofs. We test the generated proofs for logical consistency, along with the accuracy of the final inference. We observe length-generalization issues when evaluated on longer-than-trained sequences. However, we observe TLMs improve their generalization performance after being exposed to longer, exhaustive proofs. In addition, we discover that TLMs are able to generalize better using backward-chaining proofs compared to their forward-chaining counterparts, while they find it easier to generate forward chaining proofs. We observe that models that are not trained to generate proofs are better at generalizing to problems based on longer proofs. This suggests that Transformers have efficient internal reasoning strategies that are harder to interpret. These results highlight the systematic generalization behavior of TLMs in the context of logical reasoning, and we believe this work motivates deeper inspection of their underlying reasoning strategies.},

abstract = {Tabular data is the most common data format adopted by our customers ranging from retail, finance to E-commerce, and tabular data classification plays an essential role to their businesses. In this paper, we present Network On Network (NON), a practical tabular data classification model based on deep neural network to provide accurate predictions. Various deep methods have been proposed and promising progress has been made. However, most of them use operations like neural network and factorization machines to fuse the embeddings of different features directly, and linearly combine the outputs of those operations to get the final prediction. As a result, the intra-field information and the non-linear interactions between those operations (e.g. neural network and factorization machines) are ignored. Intra-field information is the information that features inside each field belong to the same field. NON is proposed to take full advantage of intra-field information and non-linear interactions. It consists of three components: field-wise network at the bottom to capture the intra-field information, across field network in the middle to choose suitable operations data-drivenly, and operation fusion network on the top to fuse outputs of the chosen operations deeply. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate NON can outperform the state-of-the-art models significantly. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative study of the features in the embedding space show NON can capture intra-field information effectively.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the problem of catastrophic forgetting (the loss or disruption of previously learned information when new information is learned) in neural networks, and explores rehearsal mechanisms (the retraining of some of the previously learned information as the new information is added) as a potential solution. We replicate some of the experiments described by Ratcliff (1990), including those relating to a simple ârecency' based rehearsal regime. We then develop further rehearsal regimes which are more effective than recency rehearsal. In particular, âsweep rehearsal' is very successful at minimizing catastrophic forgetting. One possible limitation of rehearsal in general, however, is that previously learned information may not be available for retraining. We describe a solution to this problem, âpseudorehearsal', a method which provides the advantages of rehearsal without actually requiring any access to the previously learned information (the original training population) itself. We then suggest an interpretation of these rehearsal mechanisms in the context of a function approximation based account of neural network learning. Both rehearsal and pseudorehearsal may have practical applications, allowing new information to be integrated into an existing network with minimum disruption of old information. {\textcopyright} 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract = {For artificial learning systems, continual learning over time from a stream of data is essential. The burgeoning studies on supervised continual learning have achieved great progress, while the study of catastrophic forgetting in unsupervised learning is still blank. Among unsupervised learning methods, self-supervise learning method shows tremendous potential on visual representation without any labeled data at scale. To improve the visual representation of self-supervised learning, larger and more varied data is needed. In the real world, unlabeled data is generated at all times. This circumstance provides a huge advantage for the learning of the self-supervised method. However, in the current paradigm, packing previous data and current data together and training it again is a waste of time and resources. Thus, a continual self-supervised learning method is badly needed. In this paper, we make the first attempt to implement the continual contrastive self-supervised learning by proposing a rehearsal method, which keeps a few exemplars from the previous data. Instead of directly combining saved exemplars with the current data set for training, we leverage self-supervised knowledge distillation to transfer contrastive information among previous data to the current network by mimicking similarity score distribution inferred by the old network over a set of saved exemplars. Moreover, we build an extra sample queue to assist the network to distinguish between previous and current data and prevent mutual interference while learning their own feature representation. Experimental results show that our method performs well on CIFAR100 and ImageNet-Sub. Compared with self-supervised baselines, which learning tasks one by one without taking any technique, we improve the image classification top-1 accuracy by 1.60% on CIFAR100 and 2.86% on ImageNet-Sub under 10 incremental steps setting.},

abstract = {By a linguistic variable we mean a variable whose values are words or sentences in a natural or artificial language. For example, Age is a linguistic variable if its values are linguistic rather than numerical, i.e.,young, not young, very young, quite young, old, not very old and not very young, etc., rather than 20, 21,22, 23, In more specific terms, a linguistic variable is characterized by a quintuple (L>, T(L), U,G,M) in which L is the name of the variable; T(L) is the term-set of L, that is, the collection of its linguistic values; U is a universe of discourse; G is a syntactic rule which generates the terms in T(L); and M is a semantic rule which associates with each linguistic value X its meaning, M(X), where M(X) denotes a fuzzy subset of U. The meaning of a linguistic value X is characterized by a compatibility function, c: U 0,1, which associates with each u in U its compatibility with X. Thus, the compatibility of age 27 with young might be 0.7, while that of 35 might be 0.2. The function of the semantic rule is to relate the compatibilities of the so-called primary terms in a composite linguistic value-e.g., young and old in not very young and not very old-to the compatibility of the composite value. To this end, the hedges such as very, quite, extremely, etc., as well as the connectives and and or are treated as nonlinear operators which modify the meaning of their operands in a specified fashion. The concept of a linguistic variable provides a means of approximate characterization of phenomena which are too complex or too ill-defined to be amenable to description in conventional quantitative terms. In particular, treating Truth as a linguistic variable with values such as true, very true, completely true, not very true, untrue, etc., leads to what is called fuzzy logic. By providing a basis for approximate reasoning, that is, a mode of reasoning which is not exact nor very inexact, such logic may offer a more realistic framework for human reasoning than the traditional two-valued logic. It is shown that probabilities, too, can be treated as linguistic variables with values such as likely, very likely, unlikely, etc. Computation with linguistic probabilities requires the solution of nonlinear programs and leads to results which are imprecise to the same degree as the underlying probabilities. The main applications of the linguistic approach lie in the realm of humanistic systems-especially in the fields of artificial intelligence, linguistics, human decision processes, pattern recognition, psychology, law, medical diagnosis, information retrieval, economics and related areas.},

abstract = {We study generalization under label shift in domain adaptation where the learner has access to labeled samples from the source domain but unlabeled samples from the target domain. Prior works deploy label classifiers and introduce various methods to estimate the importance weights from source to target domains. They use these estimates in importance weighted empirical risk minimization to learn classifiers. In this work, we theoretically compare the prior approaches, relax their strong assumptions, and generalize them from requiring label classifiers to general functions. This latter generalization improves the conditioning on the inverse operator of the induced inverse problems by allowing for broader exploitation of the spectrum of the forward operator. The prior works in the study of label shifts are limited to categorical label spaces. In this work, we propose a series of methods to estimate the importance weight functions for arbitrary normed label spaces. We introduce a new operator learning approach between Hilbert spaces defined on labels (rather than covariates) and show that it induces a perturbed inverse problem of compact operators. We propose a novel approach to solve the inverse problem in the presence of perturbation. This analysis has its own independent interest since such problems commonly arise in partial differential equations and reinforcement learning. For both categorical and general normed spaces, we provide concentration bounds for the proposed estimators. Using the existing generalization analysis based on Rademacher complexity, R\'enyi divergence, and MDFR lemma in Azizzadenesheli et al. [2019], we show the generalization property of the importance weighted empirical risk minimization on the unseen target domain.},

This principled framework also reveals and justifies the role of multi-channel lifting and sparse coding in early stage of deep networks. Moreover, all linear operators of the so-derived network naturally become multi-channel convolutions when we enforce classification to be rigorously shift-invariant. The derivation also indicates that such a convolutional network is significantly more efficient to construct and learn in the spectral domain. Our preliminary simulations and experiments indicate that so constructed deep network can already learn a good discriminative representation even without any back propagation training.},

abstract = {The term âfake newsâ became increasingly common during the past year. While this concept has many synonymsâdisinformation campaigns, cyber propaganda, cognitive hacking, and information warfareâit's just one facet of the bigger problem: the manipulation of public opinion to affect the real world. Thanks to the connectivity and digital platforms that make it possible to share and spread information, traditional challenges such as physical borders and the constraints of time and distance do not exist anymore. Unfortunately, it also makes it easier to manipulate the public's perception of reality and thought processes, resulting in the proliferation of fake news that affects our real, non-digital environment. Each new incident shows how much impact the technological manipulation of public opinion can have on people's daily lives. This paper studies and explores the techniques and methods used by actors to spread fake news and manipulate public opinion to serve various motives ranging from personal and financial to political. It also discusses the three legs of the fake news triangle: the services that enable them, their appearance on social media sites, and the motivations behind these activities. We demonstrate several techniques used to identify such campaigns by processing social media data and show how it is possible to trace those campaigns to the original perpetrators.},

abstract = {Gradient descent can be surprisingly good at optimizing deep neural networks without overfitting and without explicit regularization. We find that the discrete steps of gradient descent implicitly regularize models by penalizing gradient descent trajectories that have large loss gradients. We call this Implicit Gradient Regularization (IGR) and we use backward error analysis to calculate the size of this regularization. We confirm empirically that implicit gradient regularization biases gradient descent toward flat minima, where test errors are small and solutions are robust to noisy parameter perturbations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the implicit gradient regularization term can be used as an explicit regularizer, allowing us to control this gradient regularization directly. More broadly, our work indicates that backward error analysis is a useful theoretical approach to the perennial question of how learning rate, model size, and parameter regularization interact to determine the properties of overparameterized models optimized with gradient descent.},

abstract = {Few-shot meta-learning methods consider the problem of learning new tasks from a small, fixed number of examples, by meta-learning across static data from a set of previous tasks. However, in many real world settings, it is more natural to view the problem as one of minimizing the total amount of supervision --- both the number of examples needed to learn a new task and the amount of data needed for meta-learning. Such a formulation can be studied in a sequential learning setting, where tasks are presented in sequence. When studying meta-learning in this online setting, a critical question arises: can meta-learning improve over the sample complexity and regret of standard empirical risk minimization methods, when considering both meta-training and adaptation together? The answer is particularly non-obvious for meta-learning algorithms with complex bi-level optimizations that may demand large amounts of meta-training data. To answer this question, we extend previous meta-learning algorithms to handle the variable-shot settings that naturally arise in sequential learning: from many-shot learning at the start, to zero-shot learning towards the end. On sequential learning problems, we find that meta-learning solves the full task set with fewer overall labels and achieves greater cumulative performance, compared to standard supervised methods. These results suggest that meta-learning is an important ingredient for building learning systems that continuously learn and improve over a sequence of problems.},

abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic has an unprecedented impact all over the world since early 2020. During this public health crisis, reliable forecasting of the disease becomes critical for resource allocation and administrative planning. The results from compartmental models such as SIR and SEIR are popularly referred by CDC and news media. With more and more COVID-19 data becoming available, we examine the following question: Can a direct data-driven approach without modeling the disease spreading dynamics outperform the well referred compartmental models and their variants? In this paper, we show the possibility. It is observed that as COVID-19 spreads at different speed and scale in different geographic regions, it is highly likely that similar progression patterns are shared among these regions within different time periods. This intuition lead us to develop a new neural forecasting model, called Attention Crossing Time Series (\textbf{ACTS}), that makes forecasts via comparing patterns across time series obtained from multiple regions. The attention mechanism originally developed for natural language processing can be leveraged and generalized to materialize this idea. Among 13 out of 18 testings including forecasting newly confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths, \textbf{ACTS} outperforms all the leading COVID-19 forecasters highlighted by CDC.},

With only these two models, training data for previous tasks can easily be sampled and interleaved with those for a new task.

abstract = {Continual learning is a machine learning sub-field specialized in settings with non-iid data. Hence, the training data distribution is not static and drifts through time. Those drifts might cause interferences in the trained model and knowledge learned on previous states of the data distribution might be forgotten. Continual learning's challenge is to create algorithms able to learn an ever-growing amount of knowledge while dealing with data distribution drifts. One implementation difficulty in these field is to create data loaders that simulate non-iid scenarios. Indeed, data loaders are a key component for continual algorithms. They should be carefully designed and reproducible. Small errors in data loaders have a critical impact on algorithm results, e.g. with bad preprocessing, wrong order of data or bad test set. Continuum is a simple and efficient framework with numerous data loaders that avoid researcher to spend time on designing data loader and eliminate time-consuming errors. Using our proposed framework, it is possible to directly focus on the model design by using the multiple scenarios and evaluation metrics implemented. Furthermore the framework is easily extendable to add novel settings for specific needs.},

abstract = {The continual learning (CL) paradigm aims to enable neural networks to learn tasks continually in a sequential fashion. The fundamental challenge in this learning paradigm is catastrophic forgetting previously learned tasks when the model is optimized for a new task, especially when their data is not accessible. Current architectural-based methods aim at alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem but at the expense of expanding the capacity of the model. Regularization-based methods maintain a fixed model capacity; however, previous studies showed the huge performance degradation of these methods when the task identity is not available during inference (e.g. class incremental learning scenario). In this work, we propose a novel architectural-based method referred as SpaceNet for class incremental learning scenario where we utilize the available fixed capacity of the model intelligently. SpaceNet trains sparse deep neural networks from scratch in an adaptive way that compresses the sparse connections of each task in a compact number of neurons. The adaptive training of the sparse connections results in sparse representations that reduce the interference between the tasks. Experimental results show the robustness of our proposed method against catastrophic forgetting old tasks and the efficiency of SpaceNet in utilizing the available capacity of the model, leaving space for more tasks to be learned. In particular, when SpaceNet is tested on the well-known benchmarks for CL: split MNIST, split Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10/100, it outperforms regularization-based methods by a big performance gap. Moreover, it achieves better performance than architectural-based methods without model expansion and achieved comparable results with rehearsal-based methods, while offering a huge memory reduction.},

For the transesterification between rapeseed oil and methanol, the reaction time to its highest yield, 99.8%, was shortened to 2.5 h. The physical and chemical properties of catalysts were characterized by using techniques of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), BET surface area measurement (BET), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and thermogravimeter (TG). The results indicated that well dispersed CaO with relatively small particle sizes and high surface areas were obtained after modification. Furthermore, the thermal stability of modified CaO is improved and the amount of Ca(OH)2formed during the modifying process is very little. Influence of the amount of modifier and various reaction conditions, such as mass ratio of catalyst to oil, reaction temperature and molar ratio of methanol to oil, were investigated in detail.

As a result, novel methods ranging from asset network estimation to hierarchical asset selection and portfolio allocation are now part of practitioners' toolboxes. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental problem of learning undirected graphical models under Laplacian structural constraints from the point of view of financial market times series data. In particular, we present natural justifications, supported by empirical evidence, for the usage of the Laplacian matrix as a model for the precision matrix of financial assets, while also establishing a direct link that reveals how Laplacian constraints are coupled to meaningful physical interpretations related to the market index factor and to conditional correlations between stocks. Those interpretations lead to a set of guidelines that practitioners should be aware of when estimating graphs in financial markets. In addition, we design numerical algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers to learn undirected, weighted graphs that take into account stylized facts that are intrinsic to financial data such as heavy tails and modularity. We illustrate how to leverage the learned graphs into practical scenarios such as stock time series clustering and foreign exchange network estimation. The proposed graph learning algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in an extensive set of practical experiments. Furthermore, we obtain theoretical and empirical convergence results for the proposed algorithms. Along with the developed methodologies for graph learning in financial markets, we release an R package, called fingraph, accommodating the code and data to obtain all the experimental results.},

abstract = {Natural gradient descent is an optimization method traditionally motivated from the perspective of information geometry, and works well for many applications as an alternative to stochastic gradient descent. In this paper we critically analyze this method and its properties, and show how it can be viewed as a type of 2nd-order optimization method, with the Fisher information matrix acting as a substitute for the Hessian. In many important cases, the Fisher information matrix is shown to be equivalent to the Generalized Gauss-Newton matrix, which both approximates the Hessian, but also has certain properties that favor its use over the Hessian. This perspective turns out to have significant implications for the design of a practical and robust natural gradient optimizer, as it motivates the use of techniques like trust regions and Tikhonov regularization. Additionally, we make a series of contributions to the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods, including: a thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used \empirical"approximation of the Fisher matrix, and an analysis of the (approximate) parameterization invariance property possessed by natural gradient methods (which we show also holds for certain other curvature matrices, but notably not the Hessian).},

abstract = {A capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector represents the instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity such as an object or an object part. We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.},

abstract = {We present the Supermasks in Superposition (SupSup) model, capable of sequentially learning thousands of tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Our approach uses a randomly initialized, fixed base network and for each task finds a subnetwork (supermask) that achieves good performance. If task identity is given at test time, the correct subnetwork can be retrieved with minimal memory usage. If not provided, SupSup can infer the task using gradient-based optimization to find a linear superposition of learned supermasks which minimizes the output entropy. In practice we find that a single gradient step is often sufficient to identify the correct mask, even among 2500 tasks. We also showcase two promising extensions. First, SupSup models can be trained entirely without task identity information, as they may detect when they are uncertain about new data and allocate an additional supermask for the new training distribution. Finally the entire, growing set of supermasks can be stored in a constant-sized reservoir by implicitly storing them as attractors in a fixed-sized Hopfield network.},

abstract = {In the manufacturing domain, interoperability represents a characteristic of a manufacturing system in which its components are capable of exchanging information with one another, using the information that has been exchanged. Even though the discussion about interoperability issues can trace back to the 1970s, system interoperability is still the âelephant in the roomâ. Additionally, in the past few years, research topics related to the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, have been gradually accepted and promoted by governments and organizations all around the world. A research question then arises: what is the role of interoperability in the fourth industrial revolution era? The aim of this paper is to provide a scientific and evidence-based answer to this question. From an academic perspective, a systematic literature review was carried out to discover the main concepts related to interoperability in an Industry 4.0 context. From an industrial perspective, a questionnaire survey was developed to guide the application of a multi-criteria decision analysis method, the Analytic Hierarchy Process, used to analyze and make explicit the relationships of the previously discovered concepts. Results of this study can be used as a basis for future interoperability research in this new industrial revolution wave.},

This problem is especially hard to solve for time series classification and regression in industrial applications such as predictive maintenance or production line optimization, for which each label or regression target is associated with several time series and meta-information simultaneously. Here, we are proposing an efficient, scalable feature extraction algorithm for time series, which filters the available features in an early stage of the machine learning pipeline with respect to their significance for the classification or regression task, while controlling the expected percentage of selected but irrelevant features. The proposed algorithm combines established feature extraction methods with a feature importance filter. It has a low computational complexity, allows to start on a problem with only limited domain knowledge available, can be trivially parallelized, is highly scalable and based on well studied non-parametric hypothesis tests. We benchmark our proposed algorithm on all binary classification problems of the UCR time series classification archive as well as time series from a production line optimization project and simulated stochastic processes with underlying qualitative change of dynamics.},

One defining trait of relational reasoning is that it operates on a set of entities, as opposed to standard vector representations. Existing end-to-end approaches typically extract entities from inputs by directly interpreting the latent feature representations as a set. We show that these approaches do not respect set permutational invariance and thus have fundamental representational limitations. To resolve this limitation, we propose a simple and general network module called a Set Refiner Network (SRN). We first use synthetic image experiments to demonstrate how our approach effectively decomposes objects without explicit supervision. Then, we insert our module into existing relational reasoning models and show that respecting set invariance leads to substantial gains in prediction performance and robustness on several relational reasoning tasks.},

The core of human cognition lies in the structured, reusable concepts that help us to rapidly adapt to new tasks and provide reasoning behind our decisions. However, existing meta-learning methods learn complex representations across prior labeled tasks without imposing any structure on the learned representations. Here we propose COMET, a meta-learning method that improves generalization ability by learning to learn along human-interpretable concept dimensions. Instead of learning a joint unstructured metric space, COMET learns mappings of high-level concepts into semi-structured metric spaces, and effectively combines the outputs of independent concept learners. We evaluate our model on few-shot tasks from diverse domains, including fine-grained image classification, document categorization and cell type annotation on a novel dataset from a biological domain developed in our work. COMET significantly outperforms strong meta-learning baselines, achieving 6-15% relative improvement on the most challenging 1-shot learning tasks, while unlike existing methods providing interpretations behind the model's predictions.},

It is essential towards the development of intelligent machines that can adapt to their surroundings. In this work we focus on a lifelong learning approach to unsupervised generative modeling, where we continuously incorporate newly observed distributions into a learned model. We do so through a student-teacher Variational Autoencoder architecture which allows us to learn and preserve all the distributions seen so far, without the need to retain the past data nor the past models. Through the introduction of a novel cross-model regularizer, inspired by a Bayesian update rule, the student model leverages the information learned by the teacher, which acts as a probabilistic knowledge store. The regularizer reduces the effect of catastrophic interference that appears when we learn over sequences of distributions. We validate our model's performance on sequential variants of MNIST, FashionMNIST, PermutedMNIST, SVHN and Celeb-A and demonstrate that our model mitigates the effects of catastrophic interference faced by neural networks in sequential learning scenarios.},

abstract = {Power systems are going through a paradigm change. Centralized large generating facilities are being replaced with millions of widely dispersed, incompatible, non-synchronous and relatively small renewable or alternative power plants, plug-in EVs, and energy storage units. Moreover, the majority of loads are expected to actively regulate system stability as well. This paradigm change, called the democratization of power systems, is comparable to the great historical event of personal computers replacing mainframes in the technology domain or republics replacing monarchies in the political domain. In this paper, some concepts and principles in politics are borrowed to study power systems. The term synchronized and democratized smart grid (in short, SYNDEM) is coined and the most fundamental features of a democratized society, i.e., the rule of law and the legal equality, are established for SYNDEM. The synchronization mechanism of synchronous machines is identified as the natural rule of law to govern SYNDEM and the legal equality is achieved via operating power electronic converters as virtual synchronous machines (VSM) to homogenize all heterogeneous players. Then, a lateral system architecture is presented to implement SYNDEM. This actually offers a technical solution to realize the lateral power to underpin The Third Industrial Revolution envisioned by Jeremy Rifkin. As a result, all active players in a grid, large or small, conventional or renewable, supplying or consuming, can equally and laterally regulate the grid in a synchronous manner to enhance the stability, scalability, operability, reliability, security and resiliency of future power systems.

abstract = {Given an existing trained neural network, it is often desirable to learn new capabilities without hindering performance of those already learned. Existing approaches either learn sub-optimal solutions, require joint training, or incur a substantial increment in the number of parameters for each added domain, typically as many as the original network. We propose a method called Deep Adaptation Modules (DAM) that constrains newly learned filters to be linear combinations of existing ones. DAMs precisely preserve performance on the original domain, require a fraction (typically 13 percent, dependent on network architecture) of the number of parameters compared to standard fine-tuning procedures and converge in less cycles of training to a comparable or better level of performance. When coupled with standard network quantization techniques, we further reduce the parameter cost to around 3 percent of the original with negligible or no loss in accuracy. The learned architecture can be controlled to switch between various learned representations, enabling a single network to solve a task from multiple different domains. We conduct extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of our method on a range of image classification tasks and explore different aspects of its behavior.},

These huge volume of database is analysed to Predict and improve the benefits and profits of the organization and also for the development. By analysing the history of data, strategic decisions can be made to improve the performance of the organizations by the top level peoples. So organizations are interested in analysing the data which will result in valuable insight. The data subjected to mining consists of inconsistent, blank or null and noisy values which have to be cleaned before mining. Usually the Techniques of Mean, Mode, and Median will be used to clean the data which are inefficient methods. Here I am representing the efficient data pre-processing which is to be carried out before actual mining process can be performed. The data from different databases, different locations and different formats are considered for pre-processing. This results in identification of reasonable patterns to improve the performance of organization. Even the Neural Networks has complex structure, consumes more learning time and difficult to understand the representation of results, it have more acceptance ability to clean impure data with more precise and accuracy in pre-processing which results in efficient data pre-processing for Data Mining. The data pre-processing includes four stages. They are cleaning the Data, Selecting the data, Data Enhancement and Data Transformation. Cleaning the data: is to fill the empty value of the data and to ignore the noisy data and to correct the inconsistencies data. Selecting the data: is choosing the appropriate data which suits for learning. Data Enhancement: is done to enhance the data quality which has been selected. Data Expression: is to transform the data after pre-processing into the form which can be accepted by the data mining algorithm based on neural network. The data mining based on neural network can only handle numerical data, so it is need to transform the sign data into numerical data. The simplest method is to establish a table with one-to-one correspondence between the sign data and the numerical data. The other more complex approach is to adopt the appropriate Hash function to generate a unique numerical data according to given string. Although there are many data types in relational database, but they all basically can be simply come down to sign data, discrete numerical data and serial numerical data. Then, the discrete numerical data can be quantified into continuous numerical data and can also be encoded into coding data which can be easily and efficiently handled by data mining algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a novel network compression method called dynamic network surgery, which can remarkably reduce the network complexity by making on-the-fly connection pruning. Unlike the previous methods which accomplish this task in a greedy way, we properly incorporate connection splicing into the whole process to avoid incorrect pruning and make it as a continual network maintenance. The effectiveness of our method is proved with experiments. Without any accuracy loss, our method can efficiently compress the number of parameters in LeNet-5 and AlexNet by a factor of 108Ã and 17.7Ã respectively, proving that it outperforms the recent pruning method by considerable margins.

abstract = {Policy gradient methods have shown success in learning control policies for high-dimensional dynamical systems. Their biggest downside is the amount of exploration they require before yielding high-performing policies. In a lifelong learning setting, in which an agent is faced with multiple consecutive tasks over its lifetime, reusing information from previously seen tasks can substantially accelerate the learning of new tasks. We provide a novel method for lifelong policy gradient learning that trains lifelong function approximators directly via policy gradients, allowing the agent to benefit from accumulated knowledge throughout the entire training process. We show empirically that our algorithm learns faster and converges to better policies than single-task and lifelong learning baselines, and completely avoids catastrophic forgetting on a variety of challenging domains.},

The reservoir paradigm reflects and respects the high degree of recurrence in biological brains, and the role that neuronal dynamics play in learning. However, one issue hampering deep reservoir network development is that one cannot backpropagate through the reservoir layers. Recent deep reservoir architectures do not learn hidden or hierarchical representations in the same manner as deep artificial neural networks, but rather concatenate all hidden reservoirs together to perform traditional regression. Here we present a novel Deep Reservoir Network for time series prediction and classification that learns through the non-differentiable hidden reservoir layers using a biologically-inspired backpropagation alternative called Direct Feedback Alignment, which resembles global dopamine signal broadcasting in the brain. We demonstrate its efficacy on two real world multidimensional time series datasets.},

Despite their success these methods have been primarily applied to unlabeled ImageNet images, and show marginal gains when trained on larger sets of uncurated images. We hypothesize that current SSL methods perform best on iconic images, and struggle on complex scene images with many objects. Analyzing contrastive SSL methods shows that they have poor visual grounding and receive poor supervisory signal when trained on scene images. We propose Contrastive Attention-Supervised Tuning(CAST) to overcome these limitations. CAST uses unsupervised saliency maps to intelligently sample crops, and to provide grounding supervision via a Grad-CAM attention loss. Experiments on COCO show that CAST significantly improves the features learned by SSL methods on scene images, and further experiments show that CAST-trained models are more robust to changes in backgrounds.},

abstract = {In today's society, the use of computer as a tool at workplaces, academic institutions, recreation facilities and homes has become very common. It is estimated that globally, about 45 to 70 million people spend hours staring into a video display terminal, popularly known as computer screen. Several studies, mainly in developed countries, have shown an association between computer use and visual health related symptoms (Computer Vision Syndrome, CVS) in both children and adults. In this report, a review of literature on CVS was undertaken to determine the prevalence of CVS and compare the prevalence between studies. The risk factors associated with the syndrome range from individual visual problems and poor ergonomics. The most common symptoms include headache, eye strain, double vision, dry eyes, eye fatigue and other symptoms of eye strain. The prevalence of the symptoms varied between studies. It is concluded that, as computer users are increasing rapidly, they are at risk of CVS. A better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying CVS is necessary to empower practitioners to accurately diagnose and treat patients with CVS; necessary precautions and care should be exercised to prevent serious impact of CVS on productivity and sustainable economic development of countries in Africa. In addition, special attention should be given to the young population including children and students in schools, colleges and universities.},

abstract = {All natural cognitive systems, and, in particular, our own, gradually forget previously learned information. Plausible models of human cognition should therefore exhibit similar patterns of gradual forgetting of old information as new information is acquired. Only rarely does new learning in natural cognitive systems completely disrupt or erase previously learned information; that is, natural cognitive systems do not, in general, forget âcatastrophically'. Unfortunately, though, catastrophic forgetting does occur under certain circumstances in distributed connectionist networks. The very features that give these networks their remarkable abilities to generalize, to function in the presence of degraded input, and so on, are found to be the root cause of catastrophic forgetting. The challenge in this field is to discover how to keep the advantages of distributed connectionist networks while avoiding the problem of catastrophic forgetting. In this article the causes, consequences and numerous solutions to the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks are examined. The review will consider how the brain might have overcome this problem and will also explore the consequences of this solution for distributed connectionist networks.},

abstract = {Discovering and understanding the dynamic phenomena of weather to accurately predict different weather events has been an integral component of scientific investigations worldwide. The weather data, being inherently fuzzy in nature, requires highly complex processing based on human observations, satellite photography, or radar followed by computer simulations. This is further combined with an understanding of the principles of global and local weather dynamics. This paper attempts to solve weather event prediction for Lahore by implementing a fuzzy rule based system. The difficult problem of weather event prediction has been dealt in this paper through two separate experimental settings. In the first experimental setting a smaller dataset consisting of 365 instances with 4 inputs and 8 weather events has been used to develop a fuzzy inference system. In the second experimental setting the developed fuzzy system has been enhanced for a larger dataset consisting of over 2500 data points, having 17 inputs, and 10 weather events. For the later experiments the results of the fuzzy system have been compared with two other models i.e., decision tree (DT) based model and partial least square based regression (PLSR) model. It has been observed in the present study that the performance of the fuzzy system is sensitive to bootstrapping sampling technique that has been used for generating training and test samples for developing the fuzzy, DT and PLSR models. Further the models under consideration have been less sensitive to principal component analysis based dimensionality reduction method. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

When trained sequentially on new or evolving tasks, their accuracy drops sharply, making them unsuitable for many real-world applications. In this work, we shed light on the causes of this well-known yet unsolved phenomenon - often referred to as catastrophic forgetting - in a class-incremental setup. We show that a combination of simple components and a loss that balances intra-task and inter-task learning can already resolve forgetting to the same extent as more complex measures proposed in literature. Moreover, we identify poor quality of the learned representation as another reason for catastrophic forgetting in class-IL. We show that performance is correlated with secondary class information (dark knowledge) learned by the model and it can be improved by an appropriate regularizer. With these lessons learned, class-incremental learning results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet improve over the state-of-the-art by a large margin, while keeping the approach simple.},

In so doing, we provide a precise characterization of signal propagation and gradient backpropagation in wide batch-normalized networks at initialization. Our theory shows that gradient signals grow exponentially in depth and that these exploding gradients cannot be eliminated by tuning the initial weight variances or by adjusting the nonlinear activation function. Indeed, batch normalization itself is the cause of gradient explosion. As a result, vanilla batch-normalized networks without skip connections are not trainable at large depths for common initialization schemes, a prediction that we verify with a variety of empirical simulations. While gradient explosion cannot be eliminated, it can be reduced by tuning the network close to the linear regime, which improves the trainability of deep batch-normalized networks without residual connections. Finally, we investigate the learning dynamics of batch-normalized networks and observe that after a single step of optimization the networks achieve a relatively stable equilibrium in which gradients have dramatically smaller dynamic range. Our theory leverages Laplace, Fourier, and Gegenbauer transforms and we derive new identities that may be of independent interest.},

abstract = {The assessment of the sustainability impacts of eco-engineering strategies can be challenging and remains neglected within the literature and in practice. The challenge lies in achieving a balance between the delivery of project objectives and their alignment with the emerging principles of sustainable design which seek to provide an appropriate and satisfactory environmental and financial performance whilst delivering social benefits. Whilst it is possible to assess various aspects of the long term performance of soil bioengineering measures and the relevant projects in their delivery through cost evaluations, risk assessments and environmental impact assessments, there is currently no agreed means of assessing the sustainability performance of such measures in an integrated framework which captures the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability. To remediate this, we propose an integrated sustainability assessment framework which can be applied on any eco-engineering project. It is underpinned by a review of current sustainability indicators commonly applied in the range of sustainability assessment methods (SAMs) and best practice guidance within construction and geotechnical engineering. The framework comprises a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) reflective of the both engineering and sustainability requirements for eco-engineering in the context of stability, active use of vegetation and long-term sustainability for eco-engineering projects. Recognition is provided of the unique nature of each eco-engineering measure and provision is established within the framework for a contextual KPI subset to be developed through stakeholder engagement. The potential of the framework was explored through an expert workshop highlighting its value to promote benchmarking across the sector between eco-engineering projects and would allow standards to emerge for establishing best practice. Through a real-life case study, we demonstrate the benefits of the adoption of such a framework at an early stage of a project but also the benefits for stakeholders which stem from double-loop learning.},

Our experiments on the CIFAR-10, SVHN and MNIST datasets show promising improvement, with the best performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

When existing object detectors are applied to such scenarios, their performance on old classes deteriorates significantly. A few efforts have been reported to address this limitation, all of which apply variants of knowledge distillation to avoid catastrophic forgetting. We note that although distillation helps to retain previous learning, it obstructs fast adaptability to new tasks, which is a critical requirement for incremental learning. In this pursuit, we propose a meta-learning approach that learns to reshape model gradients, such that information across incremental tasks is optimally shared. This ensures a seamless information transfer via a meta-learned gradient preconditioning that minimizes forgetting and maximizes knowledge transfer. In comparison to existing meta-learning methods, our approach is task-agnostic, allows incremental addition of new-classes and scales to large-sized models for object detection. We evaluate our approach on a variety of incremental settings defined on PASCAL-VOC and MS COCO datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art.},

Now that astronomical telescopes are moving toward diffraction-limited performance through the use of adaptive optics (AO), we address the problem of coupling light into a few-mode fibre (FMF). We find that fibres with as few as $\sim$5 guided modes share important characterisitcs with multimode fibres, in particular high coupling efficiency.We anticipate that future astronomical instruments at an AO-corrected focus will be able to exploit a broad class of photonic devices.},

Particularly, we match the distributions of neuron selectivity patterns between teacher and student networks. To achieve this goal, we devise a new KT loss function by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric between these distributions. Combined with the original loss function, our method can significantly improve the performance of student networks. We validate the effectiveness of our method across several datasets, and further combine it with other KT methods to explore the best possible results. Last but not least, we fine-tune the model to other tasks such as object detection. The results are also encouraging, which confirm the transferability of the learned features.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a new and an alternative differential evolution (ADE) algorithm for solving unconstrained global optimization problems. In the new algorithm, a new directed mutation rule is introduced based on the weighted difference vector between the best and the worst individuals of a particular generation. The mutation rule is combined with the basic mutation strategy through a linear decreasing probability rule. This modification is shown to enhance the local search ability of the basic DE and to increase the convergence rate. Two new scaling factors are introduced as uniform random variables to improve the diversity of the population and to bias the search direction. Additionally, a dynamic non-linear increased crossover probability scheme is utilized to balance the global exploration and local exploitation. Furthermore, a random mutation scheme and a modified Breeder Genetic Algorithm (BGA) mutation scheme are merged to avoid stagnation and/or premature convergence. Numerical experiments and comparisons on a set of well-known high dimensional benchmark functions indicate that the improved algorithm outperforms and is superior to other existing algorithms in terms of final solution quality, success rate, convergence rate, and robustness. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Egocentric gestures are the most natural form of communication for humans to interact with wearable devices such as VR/AR helmets and glasses. A major issue in such scenarios for real-world applications is that may easily become necessary to add new gestures to the system e.g., a proper VR system should allow users to customize gestures incrementally. Traditional deep learning methods require storing all previous class samples in the system and training the model again from scratch by incorporating previous samples and new samples, which costs humongous memory and significantly increases computation over time. In this work, we demonstrate a lifelong 3D convolutional framework - c(C)la(a)ss increment(t)al net(Net)works (CatNet), which considers temporal information in videos and enables life-long learning for egocentric gesture video recognition by learning the feature representation of an exemplar set selected from previous class samples. Importantly, we propose a two-stream CatNet, which deploys RGB and depth modalities to train two separate networks. We evaluate Cat- Nets on a publicly available dataset - EgoGesture dataset, and show that CatNets can learn many classes incrementally over a long period of time. Results also demonstrate that the two-stream architecture achieves the best performance on both joint training and class incremental training compared to 3 other one-stream architectures.

abstract = {Deep neural networks have shown promise in several domains, and the learned task-specific information is implicitly stored in the network parameters. It will be vital to utilize representations from these networks for downstream tasks such as continual learning. In this paper, we introduce the notion of {\em flashcards} that are visual representations to {\em capture} the encoded knowledge of a network, as a function of random image patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of flashcards in capturing representations and show that they are efficient replay methods for general and task agnostic continual learning setting. Thus, while adapting to a new task, a limited number of constructed flashcards, help to prevent catastrophic forgetting of the previously learned tasks. Most interestingly, such flashcards neither require external memory storage nor need to be accumulated over multiple tasks and only need to be constructed just before learning the subsequent new task, irrespective of the number of tasks trained before and are hence task agnostic. We first demonstrate the efficacy of flashcards in capturing knowledge representation from a trained network, and empirically validate the efficacy of flashcards on a variety of continual learning tasks: continual unsupervised reconstruction, continual denoising, and new-instance learning classification, using a number of heterogeneous benchmark datasets. These studies also indicate that continual learning algorithms with flashcards as the replay strategy perform better than other state-of-the-art replay methods, and exhibits on par performance with the best possible baseline using coreset sampling, with the least additional computational complexity and storage.},

abstract = {While ground truth depth data remains hard to obtain, self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods enjoy growing attention. Much research in this area aims at improving loss functions or network architectures. Most works, however, do not leverage self-supervision to its full potential. They stick to the standard closed world train-test pipeline, assuming the network parameters to be fixed after the training is finished. Such an assumption does not allow to adapt to new scenes, whereas with self-supervision this becomes possible without extra annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised Continuous Monocular Depth Adaptation method (CoMoDA), which adapts the pretrained model on a test video on the fly. As opposed to existing test-time refinement methods that use isolated frame triplets, we opt for continuous adaptation, making use of the previous experience from the same scene. We additionally augment the proposed procedure with the experience from the distant past, preventing the model from overfitting and thus forgetting already learnt information. We demonstrate that our method can be used for both intra-and cross-dataset adaptation. By adapting the model from train to test set of the Eigen split of KITTI, we achieve state-of-the-art depth estimation performance and surpass all existing methods using standard architectures. We also show that our method runs 15 times faster than existing test-time refinement methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Yevkuzn/CoMoDA.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has been the prevalent paradigm for creating natural language understanding datasets in recent years. A common crowdsourcing practice is to recruit a small number of high-quality workers, and have them massively generate examples. Having only a few workers generate the majority of examples raises concerns about data diversity, especially when workers freely generate sentences. In this paper, we perform a series of experiments showing these concerns are evident in three recent NLP datasets. We show that model performance improves when training with annotator identifiers as features, and that models are able to recognize the most productive annotators. Moreover, we show that often models do not generalize well to examples from annotators that did not contribute to the training set. Our findings suggest that annotator bias should be monitored during dataset creation, and that test set annotators should be disjoint from training set annotators.},

abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting refers to the tendency that a neural network "forgets" the previous learned knowledge upon learning new tasks. Prior methods have been focused on overcoming this problem on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where the input samples like images lie in a grid domain, but have largely overlooked graph neural networks (GNNs) that handle non-grid data. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme dedicated to overcoming catastrophic forgetting problem and hence strengthen continual learning in GNNs. At the heart of our approach is a generic module, termed as topology-aware weight preserving$\sim$(TWP), applicable to arbitrary form of GNNs in a plug-and-play fashion. Unlike the main stream of CNN-based continual learning methods that rely on solely slowing down the updates of parameters important to the downstream task, TWP explicitly explores the local structures of the input graph, and attempts to stabilize the parameters playing pivotal roles in the topological aggregation. We evaluate TWP on different GNN backbones over several datasets, and demonstrate that it yields performances superior to the state of the art.

abstract = {Although various clinical imaging modalities have been developed to visualize internal body structures and detect abnormal tissues prior to surgical procedures, most medical imaging modalities do not provide disease-specific images in real-time. Optical imaging can provide the surgeon with real-time visualization of the surgical field for intraoperative image-guided surgery. Imaging in the near-infrared (NIR) window (650-900 nm), also known as the "therapeutic window" has high potential by offering low absorbance and scattering in tissues resulting in minimized background autofluorescence. Clinically, optical fluorescence imaging with the targeted contrast agents provides opportunities for significant advances in intraoperative image-guided surgery. There are only two clinically available NIR fluorophores, indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB), that support the image-guided surgery. However, neither of them perform in vivo by providing optimum specificity and stability for targeted image guidance. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop targeted NIR fluorophores for unmet clinical needs. Using the right combination of an NIR fluorescence imaging system and a targeted fluorophore, the desired target tissues can be imaged to provide real-time fluorescence guidance without changing the field-of-view during surgery. Thus, in a clinical discipline, the development of NIR fluorophores for 'structure-inherent targeting' is an unmet need for early phase diagnostics with accurate targeting.},

abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid Genetic-Bees Algorithm based optimised solution for the single machine scheduling problem. The enhancement of the Bees Algorithm (BA) is conducted using the Genetic Algorithm's (GA's) operators during the global search stage. The proposed enhancement aims to increase the global search capability of the BA gradually with new additions. Although the BA has very successful implementations on various type of optimisation problems, it has found that the algorithm suffers from weak global search ability which increases the computational complexities on NP-hard type optimisation problems e.g. combinatorial/permutational type optimisation problems. This weakness occurs due to using a simple global random search operation during the search process. To reinforce the global search process in the BA, the proposed enhancement is utilised to increase exploration capability by expanding the number of fittest solutions through the genetical variations of promising solutions. The hybridisation process is realised by including two strategies into the basic BA, named as âreinforced global searchâ and âjumping functionâ strategies. The reinforced global search strategy is the first stage of the hybridisation process and contains the mutation operator of the GA. The second strategy, jumping function strategy, consists of four GA operators as single point crossover, multipoint crossover, mutation and randomisation. To demonstrate the strength of the proposed solution, several experiments were carried out on 280 well-known single machine benchmark instances, and the results are presented by comparing to other well-known heuristic algorithms. According to the experiments, the proposed enhancements provides better capability to basic BA to jump from local minima, and GBA performed better compared to BA in terms of convergence and the quality of results. The convergence time reduced about 60% with about 30% better results for highly constrained jobs.},

Softmax neural nets cannot capture epistemic uncertainty reliably because for OoD points they extrapolate arbitrarily and suffer from feature collapse. This results in arbitrary softmax entropies for OoD points which can have high entropy, low, or anything in between. We study why, and show that with the right inductive biases, softmax neural nets trained with maximum likelihood reliably capture epistemic uncertainty through the feature-space density. This density is obtained using Gaussian Discriminant Analysis, but it cannot disentangle uncertainties. We show that it is necessary to combine this density with the softmax entropy to disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty -- crucial e.g. for active learning. We examine the quality of epistemic uncertainty on active learning and OoD detection, where we obtain SOTA $\sim$0.98 AUROC on CIFAR-10 vs SVHN.},

We used datasets without missing data and randomly missing data to evaluate the new method of estimation by using the Box - Jenkins modeling technique to predict monthly average rainfall for site 5504035 Lahar Ikan Mati at Kepala Batas, P. Pinang station in Malaysia. The rainfall data was collected from the $1^{st}$ January 1969 to $31^{st}$ December 1997 in the station. The data used in the development of the model to predict rainfall were represented by an autoregressive integrated moving - average (ARIMA) model. The model for both datasets was ARIMA$(1,0,0)(0,1,1)_s$. The result checked with the Naive test, which is the Thiel's statistic and was found to be equal to $U=0.72086$ for the complete data and $U=0.726352$ for the missing data, which mean they were good models.},

However, the domain where image captioning working with continual learning has not yet been explored. We define the task in which we consolidate continual learning and image captioning as continual image captioning. In this work, we propose ContCap, a framework generating captions over a series of new tasks coming, seamlessly integrating continual learning into image captioning besides addressing catastrophic forgetting. After proving forgetting in image captioning, we propose various techniques to overcome the forgetting dilemma by taking a simple fine-tuning schema as the baseline. We split MS-COCO 2014 dataset to perform experiments in class-incremental settings without revisiting dataset of previously provided tasks. Experiments show remarkable improvements in the performance on the old tasks while the figures for the new surprisingly surpass fine-tuning.

plasmon polaritons via acoustic waves at subterahertz frequency range.
The acoustic structures considered are designed as phononic Fabry-Perot
microresonators where mirrors are presented with an acoustic
superlattice and the structure's surface, and a plasmonic grating is
placed on top of the acoustic cavity so formed. It provides phonon
localization in the vicinity of the plasmonic grating at frequencies
within the phononic stop band enhancing phonon - light interaction. We
consider phonon excitation by shining a femtosecond laser pulse on the
plasmonic grating. Appropriate theoretical model was used to describe
the acoustic process caused by the pump laser pulse in the
GaAs/AlAs-based acoustic cavity with a gold grating on top. Strongest
modulation is achieved upon excitation of propagating surface plasmon
polaritons and hybridization of propagating and localized plasmons. The
relative changes in the optical reflectivity of the structure are more
than an order of magnitude higher than for the structure without the
plasmonic film. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America},

abstract = {Human behavior and affect is inherently a dynamic phenomenon involving temporal evolution of patterns manifested through a multiplicity of non-verbal behavioral cues including facial expressions, body postures and gestures, and vocal outbursts. A natural assumption for human behavior modeling is that a continuous-time characterization of behavior is the output of a linear time-invariant system when behavioral cues act as the input (e.g., continuous rather than discrete annotations of dimensional affect). Here we study the learning of such dynamical system under real-world conditions, namely in the presence of noisy behavioral cues descriptors and possibly unreliable annotations by employing structured rank minimization. To this end, a novel structured rank minimization method and its scalable variant are proposed. The generalizability of the proposed framework is demonstrated by conducting experiments on 3 distinct dynamic behavior analysis tasks, namely (i) conflict intensity prediction, (ii) prediction of valence and arousal, and (iii) tracklet matching. The attained results outperform those achieved by other state-of-the-art methods for these tasks and, hence, evidence the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s).},

They suffer from âcatastrophic forgettingââan abrupt degradation of performance on the original set of classes, when the training objective is adapted to the new classes. We present a method to address this issue, and learn object detectors incrementally, when neither the original training data nor annotations for the original classes in the new training set are available. The core of our proposed solution is a loss function to balance the interplay between predictions on the new classes and a new distillation loss which minimizes the discrepancy between responses for old classes from the original and the updated networks. This incremental learning can be performed multiple times, for a new set of classes in each step, with a moderate drop in performance compared to the baseline network trained on the ensemble of data. We present object detection results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and COCO datasets, along with a detailed empirical analysis of the approach.},

abstract = {Humans learn all their life long. They accumulate knowledge from a sequence of learning experiences and remember the essential concepts without forgetting what they have learned previously. Artificial neural networks struggle to learn similarly. They often rely on data rigorously preprocessed to learn solutions to specific problems such as classification or regression. In particular, they forget their past learning experiences if trained on new ones. Therefore, artificial neural networks are often inept to deal with real-life settings such as an autonomous-robot that has to learn on-line to adapt to new situations and overcome new problems without forgetting its past learning-experiences. Continual learning (CL) is a branch of machine learning addressing this type of problem. Continual algorithms are designed to accumulate and improve knowledge in a curriculum of learning-experiences without forgetting. In this thesis, we propose to explore continual algorithms with replay processes. Replay processes gather together rehearsal methods and generative replay methods. Generative Replay consists of regenerating past learning experiences with a generative model to remember them. Rehearsal consists of saving a core-set of samples from past learning experiences to rehearse them later. The replay processes make possible a compromise between optimizing the current learning objective and the past ones enabling learning without forgetting in sequences of tasks settings. We show that they are very promising methods for continual learning. Notably, they enable the reevaluation of past data with new knowledge and the confrontation of data from different learning-experiences. We demonstrate their ability to learn continually through unsupervised learning, supervised learning and reinforcement learning tasks.},

abstract = {This paper studies the electricity generating capacity of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Unlike most of MFC research, which targets the long term goals of renewable energy production and wastewater treatment, this paper considers a niche application that may be used immediately in practice, namely powering sensors from soils or sediments. There are two major goals in this study. The first goal is to examine the performance characteristics of MFCs in this application. Specifically we investigate the relationship between the percentage of organic matter in a sample and the electrical ca-pacity of MFCs fueled by that sample. We observe that higher percentage of organic matter in a sample results in higher electricity production of MFCs powered by that sample. We measure the thermal limits that dictate the temperature range in which MFCs can function, and confirm that the upper thermal limit is 40ËC. The new observation is that the lower thermal limit is â5ËC, which is lower than 0ËC reported in the literature. This difference is important for powering environmental sensors. We observe that the electricity production of MFCs decreases almost linearly over a period of 10 days. The second goal is to determine the conditions under which MFCs work most efficiently to generate electricity. We compare the capacity under a variety of conditions of sample types (benthic mud, top soil, and marsh samples), temperatures (0ËC, 40ËC, and room temperature), and sample sizes (measuring 3.5 cm Ã 3.5 cm Ã 4.6 cm, 10.2 cm Ã 10.2 cm Ã 13.4 cm, and 2.7 cm Ã 2.7 cm Ã 3.8 cm), and find that the electricity capacity is greatest at 0ËC, powered by benthic mud sample with the largest chamber size. What seems surprising is that 0ËC outperforms both room tempera-ture and benthic mud sample outperforms marsh sample, which appears to be richer in organic matter. In addition, we notice that although the largest chamber size produces the greatest capacity, it suffers from efficiency loss. The reasons of these observations will be explained in the paper. The study demonstrates that the electricity production of MFCs can be increased by selecting the right condition of sample type, temperature, and chamber size.},

In a series of experiments which required observers to access existing object knowledge, we observed that real-world objects have a consistent visual size at which they are drawn, imagined, and preferentially viewed. Importantly, this visual size is proportional to the logarithm of the assumed size of the object in the world, and is best characterized not as a fixed visual angle, but by the ratio of the object and the frame of space around it. Akin to the previous literature on canonical perspective, we term this consistent visual size information the canonical visual size. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {We propose an automatic system for organizing the content of a collection of unstructured videos of an articulated object class (e.g. tiger, horse). By exploiting the recurring motion patterns of the class across videos, our system: 1) identifies its characteristic behaviors; and 2) recovers pixel-to-pixel alignments across different instances. Our system can be useful for organizing video collections for indexing and retrieval. Moreover, it can be a platform for learning the appearance or behaviors of object classes from Internet video. Traditional supervised techniques cannot exploit this wealth of data directly, as they require a large amount of time-consuming manual annotations. The behavior discovery stage generates temporal video intervals, each automatically trimmed to one instance of the discovered behavior, clustered by type. It relies on our novel motion representation for articulated motion based on the displacement of ordered pairs of trajectories (PoTs). The alignment stage aligns hundreds of instances of the class to a great accuracy despite considerable appearance variations (e.g. an adult tiger and a cub). It uses a flexible Thin Plate Spline deformation model that can vary through time. We carefully evaluate each step of our system on a new, fully annotated dataset. On behavior discovery, we outperform the state-of-the-art Improved DTF descriptor. On spatial alignment, we outperform the popular SIFT Flow algorithm.},

abstract = {Siamese networks have become a common structure in various recent models for unsupervised visual representation learning. These models maximize the similarity between two augmentations of one image, subject to certain conditions for avoiding collapsing solutions. In this paper, we report surprising empirical results that simple Siamese networks can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) negative sample pairs, (ii) large batches, (iii) momentum encoders. Our experiments show that collapsing solutions do exist for the loss and structure, but a stop-gradient operation plays an essential role in preventing collapsing. We provide a hypothesis on the implication of stop-gradient, and further show proof-of-concept experiments verifying it. Our "SimSiam" method achieves competitive results on ImageNet and downstream tasks. We hope this simple baseline will motivate people to rethink the roles of Siamese architectures for unsupervised representation learning. Code will be made available.},

abstract = {Training sparse networks to converge to the same performance as dense neural architectures has proven to be elusive. Recent work suggests that initialization is the key. However, while this direction of research has had some success, focusing on initialization alone appears to be inadequate. In this paper, we take a broader view of training sparse networks and consider the role of regularization, optimization and architecture choices on sparse models. We propose a simple experimental framework, Same Capacity Sparse vs Dense Comparison (SC-SDC), that allows for fair comparison of sparse and dense networks. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of gradient flow, Effective Gradient Flow (EGF), that better correlates to performance in sparse networks. Using top-line metrics, SC-SDC and EGF, we show that default choices of optimizers, activation functions and regularizers used for dense networks can disadvantage sparse networks. Based upon these findings, we show that gradient flow in sparse networks can be improved by reconsidering aspects of the architecture design and the training regime. Our work suggests that initialization is only one piece of the puzzle and taking a wider view of tailoring optimization to sparse networks yields promising results.},

abstract = {Despite their success for semantic segmentation, convolutional neural networks are ill-equipped for incremental learning, \ie, adapting the original segmentation model as new classes are available but the initial training data is not retained. Actually, they are vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting problem. We try to address this issue by "inverting" the trained segmentation network to synthesize input images starting from random noise. To avoid setting detailed pixel-wise segmentation maps as the supervision manually, we propose the SegInversion to synthesize images using the image-level labels. To increase the diversity of synthetic images, the Scale-Aware Aggregation module is integrated into SegInversion for controlling the scale (the number of pixels) of synthetic objects. Along with real images of new classes, the synthesized images will be fed into the distillation-based framework to train the new segmentation model which retains the information about previously learned classes, whilst updating the current model to learn the new ones. The proposed method significantly outperforms other incremental learning methods and obtains state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets.

abstract = {The traditional fuzzy neural network often uses BP algorithm to optimize parameters when conducting parameter identification. However, BP algorithm tends to be trapped in local extremum. In view of the shortcomings of this method, this paper combines the differential evolution algorithm with the BP algorithm, and proposes an improved differential evolution BP algorithm to optimize the fuzzy neural network forecasting network traffic. In order to solve problems such as slow convergence speed and tendency of premature convergence existing in differential evolution algorithm, an improved differential evolution algorithm using the adaptive mutation operator and Gaussian disturbance crossover operator aims to improve the mutation of standard differential evolution algorithm and the design of crossover operators. To validate the effectiveness of it, this optimized fuzzy neural network forecasting algorithm is applied to four standard test functions and the actual network traffic. Simulation results show that the convergence speed and forecasting accuracy of the proposed algorithm are better than those of the traditional fuzzy neural network algorithm. It improves not only the generalization ability of the fuzzy neural network but also the forecasting accuracy of the network traffic.},

abstract = {Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art perfor- mance in semantic image segmentation, but the results pro- vided by fully automatic algorithms are not always guar- anteed satisfactory to users. Interactive segmentation offers a solution by accepting user annotations on selective areas of the images to refine the segmentation results. However, most existing models only focus on correcting the current im- age's misclassified pixels, with no knowledge carried over to other images. In this work, we formulate interactive image segmentation as a continual learning problem and propose a framework to effectively learn from user annotations, aim- ing to improve the segmentation on both the current image and unseen images in future tasks while avoiding deterio- rated performance on previously-seen images. It employs a probabilistic mask to control the neural network's kernel ac- tivation and extract the most suitable features for segmenting images in each task. We also design a task-aware architec- ture to automatically infer the optimal kernel activation for initial segmentation and subsequent refinement. Interactions with users are guided through multi-source uncertainty esti- mation so that users can focus on the most important areas to minimize the overall manual annotation effort. Extensive experiments are performed on both medical and natural im- age datasets to illustrate the proposed framework's effective- ness on basic segmentation performance, forward knowledge transfer, and backward knowledge transfer.

At run time, we apply the classifier (running on your phone) to predict which foods are present in your meal, and we lookup the corresponding nutritional facts. We apply this method to a new dataset of images from 23 different restaurants, using a CNN-based classifier, significantly outperforming previous work. The more challenging setting works outside of restaurants. In this case, we need to estimate the size of the foods, as well as their labels. This requires solving segmentation and depth / volume estimation from a single image. We present CNN-based approaches to these problems, with promising preliminary results.},

abstract = {Attaining prototypical features to represent class distributions is well established in representation learning. However, learning prototypes online from streaming data proves a challenging endeavor as they rapidly become outdated, caused by an ever-changing parameter space during the learning process. Additionally, continual learning does not assume the data stream to be stationary, typically resulting in catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. As a first, we introduce a system addressing both problems, where prototypes evolve continually in a shared latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point in time. In contrast to the major body of work in continual learning, data streams are processed in an online fashion, without additional task-information, and an efficient memory scheme provides robustness to imbalanced data streams. Besides nearest neighbor based prediction, learning is facilitated by a novel objective function, encouraging cluster density about the class prototype and increased inter-class variance. Furthermore, the latent space quality is elevated by pseudo-prototypes in each batch, constituted by replay of exemplars from memory. As an additional contribution, we generalize the existing paradigms in continual learning to incorporate data incremental learning from data streams by formalizing a two-agent learner-evaluator framework. We obtain state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin on eight benchmarks, including three highly imbalanced data streams.},

Notably, semi-parametric partially linear model as a powerful tool to incorporate statistical parametric and non-parametric regression analyses has gained attentions in many real-life applications recently. However, fuzzy data find application in many real studies. This study is an investigation of semi-parametric partially linear model for such cases to improve the conventional fuzzy linear regression models with fuzzy inputs, fuzzy outputs, fuzzy smooth function and non-fuzzy coefficients. For this purpose, a hybrid procedure is suggested based on curve fitting methods and least absolutes deviations to estimate the fuzzy smooth function and fuzzy coefficients. The proposed method is also examined to be compared with a common fuzzy linear regression model via a simulation data set and some real fuzzy data sets. It is shown that the proposed fuzzy regression model performs more convenient and efficient results in regard to six goodness-of-fit criteria which concludes that the proposed model could be a rational substituted model of some common fuzzy regression models in many practical studies of fuzzy regression model in expert and intelligent systems.},

abstract = {Skin conditions affect an estimated 1.9 billion people worldwide. A shortage of dermatologists causes long wait times and leads patients to seek dermatologic care from general practitioners. However, the diagnostic accuracy of general practitioners has been reported to be only 0.24-0.70 (compared to 0.77-0.96 for dermatologists), resulting in referral errors, delays in care, and errors in diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we developed a deep learning system (DLS) to provide a differential diagnosis of skin conditions for clinical cases (skin photographs and associated medical histories). The DLS distinguishes between 26 skin conditions that represent roughly 80% of the volume of skin conditions seen in primary care. The DLS was developed and validated using de-identified cases from a teledermatology practice serving 17 clinical sites via a temporal split: the first 14,021 cases for development and the last 3,756 cases for validation. On the validation set, where a panel of three board-certified dermatologists defined the reference standard for every case, the DLS achieved 0.71 and 0.93 top-1 and top-3 accuracies respectively. For a random subset of the validation set (n=963 cases), 18 clinicians reviewed the cases for comparison. On this subset, the DLS achieved a 0.67 top-1 accuracy, non-inferior to board-certified dermatologists (0.63, p<0.001), and higher than primary care physicians (PCPs, 0.45) and nurse practitioners (NPs, 0.41). The top-3 accuracy showed a similar trend: 0.90 DLS, 0.75 dermatologists, 0.60 PCPs, and 0.55 NPs. These results highlight the potential of the DLS to augment general practitioners to accurately diagnose skin conditions by suggesting differential diagnoses that may not have been considered. Future work will be needed to prospectively assess the clinical impact of using this tool in actual clinical workflows.},

abstract = {Recently, contrastive learning has largely advanced the progress of unsupervised visual representation learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet, some self-supervised algorithms reported higher transfer learning performance compared to fully-supervised methods, seeming to deliver the message that human labels hardly contribute to learning transferrable visual features. In this paper, we defend the usefulness of semantic labels but point out that fully-supervised and self-supervised methods are pursuing different kinds of features. To alleviate this issue, we present a new algorithm named Supervised Contrastive Adjustment in Neighborhood (SCAN) that maximally prevents the semantic guidance from damaging the appearance feature embedding. In a series of downstream tasks, SCAN achieves superior performance compared to previous fully-supervised and self-supervised methods, and sometimes the gain is significant. More importantly, our study reveals that semantic labels are useful in assisting self-supervised methods, opening a new direction for the community.},

abstract = {FERROELECTRIC materials are characterized by a switchable macroscopic polarization. Most technologically important ferroelectrics are oxides with a perovskite structure. The origin of their ferroelectric behaviour is unclear, however, and there is incomplete understanding of why similar, but chemically different, perovskites should display very different ferroelectric behaviour. The great sensitivity of ferroelectrics to chemistry, defects, electrical boundary conditions and pressure arises from a delicate balance between long-range Coulomb forces (which favour the ferroelectric state) and short-range repulsions (which favour the nonpolar cubic structure). To model the transition accurately, total-energy techniques are required which incorporate the effects of charge distortion and covalency. Here I report results of electronic-structure calculations on two classic examples of ferroelectric perovskites, BaTiO3 and PbTiO3, and demonstrate that hybridization between the titanium 3d states and the oxygen 2p states is essential for ferroelectricity. The different ferroelectric phase behaviour of the two materials is also clear: in PbTiO3, the lead and oxygen states hybridize, leading to a large strain that stabilizes the tetragonal phase, whereas in BaTiO3 the interaction between barium and oxygen is completely ionic, favouring a rhombohedral structure.},

abstract = {We discuss a general formulation for the Continual Learning (CL) problem for classification-a learning task where a stream provides samples to a learner and the goal of the learner, depending on the samples it receives, is to continually upgrade its knowledge about the old classes and learn new ones. Our formulation takes inspiration from the open-set recognition problem where test scenarios do not necessarily belong to the training distribution. We also discuss various quirks and assumptions encoded in recently proposed approaches for CL. We argue that some oversimplify the problem to an extent that leaves it with very little practical importance, and makes it extremely easy to perform well on. To validate this, we propose GDumb that (1) greedily stores samples in memory as they come and; (2) at test time, trains a model from scratch using samples only in the memory. We show that even though GDumb is not specifically designed for CL problems, it obtains state-of-the-art accuracies (often with large margins) in almost all the experiments when compared to a multitude of recently proposed algorithms. Surprisingly, it outperforms approaches in CL formulations for which they were specifically designed. This, we believe, raises concerns regarding our progress in CL for classification. Overall, we hope our formulation, characterizations and discussions will help in designing realistically useful CL algorithms, and GDumb will serve as a strong contender for the same.},

This technology is promising for the replacement of electrochemical batteries in low power autonomous sensors and microdevices capturing vibrations in the $\mu$W-mW range. Most of piezoelectric MEMS devices, reported in the last few years, exhibit low generated power/voltage and are not suitable for practical applications. This work reviews the current status of MEMS energy harvesters based on piezoelectric thin films, highlighting approaches/strategies to face the two main challenges to be addressed for high performance devices, namely generated power and frequency bandwidth. The paper introduces the theoretical principles and the main figures of merit of energy conversion in piezoelectric thin films and devices. After an overview on piezoelectric thin films for energy harvesting applications, highlighting their key properties, the manuscript reports a comprehensive survey on the state of the art for this device technology.

abstract = {Existing literature in Continual Learning (CL) has focused on overcoming catastrophic forgetting, the inability of the learner to recall how to perform tasks observed in the past. There are however other desirable properties of a CL system, such as the ability to transfer knowledge from previous tasks and to scale memory and compute sub-linearly with the number of tasks. Since most current benchmarks focus only on forgetting using short streams of tasks, we first propose a new suite of benchmarks to probe CL algorithms across these new axes. Finally, we introduce a new modular architecture, whose modules represent atomic skills that can be composed to perform a certain task. Learning a task reduces to figuring out which past modules to re-use, and which new modules to instantiate to solve the current task. Our learning algorithm leverages a task-driven prior over the exponential search space of all possible ways to combine modules, enabling efficient learning on long streams of tasks. Our experiments show that this modular architecture and learning algorithm perform competitively on widely used CL benchmarks while yielding superior performance on the more challenging benchmarks we introduce in this work.},

abstract = {Deep generative models allow for photorealistic image synthesis at high resolutions. But for many applications, this is not enough: content creation also needs to be controllable. While several recent works investigate how to disentangle underlying factors of variation in the data, most of them operate in 2D and hence ignore that our world is three-dimensional. Further, only few works consider the compositional nature of scenes. Our key hypothesis is that incorporating a compositional 3D scene representation into the generative model leads to more controllable image synthesis. Representing scenes as compositional generative neural feature fields allows us to disentangle one or multiple objects from the background as well as individual objects' shapes and appearances while learning from unstructured and unposed image collections without any additional supervision. Combining this scene representation with a neural rendering pipeline yields a fast and realistic image synthesis model. As evidenced by our experiments, our model is able to disentangle individual objects and allows for translating and rotating them in the scene as well as changing the camera pose.},

abstract = {Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works.},

abstract = {Recent work has described neural-network-based agents that are trained to execute language-like commands in simulated worlds, as a step towards an intelligent agent or robot that can be instructed by human users. However, the instructions that such agents are trained to follow are typically generated from templates (by an environment simulator), and do not reflect the varied or ambiguous expressions used by real people. We address this issue by integrating language encoders that are pretrained on large text corpora into a situated, instruction-following agent. In a procedurally-randomized first-person 3D world, we first train agents to follow synthetic instructions requiring the identification, manipulation and relative positioning of visually-realistic object models. We then show how these abilities can transfer to a context where humans provide instructions in natural language, but only when agents are endowed with language encoding components that were pretrained on text-data. We explore techniques for integrating text-trained and environment-trained components into an agent, observing clear advantages for the fully-contextual phrase representations computed by the well-known BERT model, and additional gains by integrating a self-attention operation optimized to adapt BERT's representations for the agent's tasks and environment. These results bridge the gap between two successful strands of recent AI research: agent-centric behavior optimization and text-based representation learning.},

We tile anchors on a wide range of layers to ensure that all scales of faces have enough features for detection.

abstract = {Heterogeneous catalysts are promising for the transesterification reaction of vegetable oils to produce biodiesel. Unlike homogeneous, heterogeneous catalysts are environmentally benign and could be operated in continuous processes. Moreover they can be reused and regenerated. However a high molar ratio of alcohol to oil, large amount of catalyst and high temperature and pressure are required when utilizing heterogeneous catalyst to produce biodiesel. In this paper, the catalytic activity of several solid base and acid catalysts, particularly metal oxides and supported metal oxides, was reviewed. Solid acid catalysts were able to do transesterification and esterification reactions simultaneously and convert oils with high amount of FFA (Free Fatty Acids). However, the reaction rate in the presence of solid base catalysts was faster. The catalyst efficiency depended on several factors such as specific surface area, pore size, pore volume and active site concentration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Normalization operations are widely used to train deep neural networks, and they can improve both convergence and generalization in most tasks. The theories for normalization's effectiveness and new forms of normalization have always been hot topics in research. To better understand normalization, one question can be whether normalization is indispensable for training deep neural networks? In this paper, we analyze what would happen when normalization layers are removed from the networks, and show how to train deep neural networks without normalization layers and without performance degradation. Our proposed method can achieve the same or even slightly better performance in a variety of tasks: image classification in ImageNet, object detection and segmentation in MS-COCO, video classification in Kinetics, and machine translation in WMT English-German, etc. Our study may help better understand the role of normalization layers and can be a competitive alternative to normalization layers.

abstract = {Measuring concept generalization, i.e., the extent to which models trained on a set of (seen) visual concepts can be used to recognize a new set of (unseen) concepts, is a popular way of evaluating visual representations, especially when they are learned with self-supervised learning. Nonetheless, the choice of which unseen concepts to use is usually made arbitrarily, and independently from the seen concepts used to train representations, thus ignoring any semantic relationships between the two. In this paper, we argue that semantic relationships between seen and unseen concepts affect generalization performance and propose ImageNet-CoG, a novel benchmark on the ImageNet dataset that enables measuring concept generalization in a principled way. Our benchmark leverages expert knowledge that comes from WordNet in order to define a sequence of unseen ImageNet concept sets that are semantically more and more distant from the ImageNet-1K subset, a ubiquitous training set. This allows us to benchmark visual representations learned on ImageNet-1K out-of-the box: we analyse a number of such models from supervised, semi-supervised and self-supervised approaches under the prism of concept generalization, and show how our benchmark is able to uncover a number of interesting insights. We will provide resources for the benchmark at https://europe.naverlabs.com/cog-benchmark.},

The catalysts have some advantages, such as abundant occurrence, low cost, porous structure, and nontoxic. The materials were characterized by XRD, FTIR, TG/DTG, CO2-TPD, XPS, SEM, and BET methods. The thermal treatment produces small particles of CaCO3and CaO that are responsible for the catalytic activity. The conversion from triglycerides to methyl ester was not observed in transesterification carried out using natural crab shell and eggshell. Under optimized reaction conditions, the conversions to YFAMEusing the calcined catalysts were: crab shell (83.10Â±0.27wt.%) and eggshell (97.75Â±0.02wt.%).

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated dominating performance in many fields; since AlexNet, networks used in practice are going wider and deeper. On the theoretical side, a long line of works have been focusing on why we can train neural networks when there is only one hidden layer. The theory of multi-layer networks remains unsettled. In this work, we prove simple algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can find global minima on the training objective of DNNs in polynomial time. We only make two assumptions: the inputs do not degenerate and the network is over-parameterized. The latter means the number of hidden neurons is sufficiently large: polynomial in L, the number of DNN layers and in n, the number of training samples. As concrete examples, starting from randomly initialized weights, we show that SGD attains 100% training accuracy in classification tasks, or minimizes regression loss in linear convergence speed $\epsilon$ e-$\Omega$(T) with running time polynomial in n and L. Our theory applies to the widely-used but non-smooth ReLU activation, and to any smooth and possibly non-convex loss functions. In terms of network architectures, our theory at least applies to fully-connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and residual neural networks (ResNet).},

abstract = {Parking is an issue at the forefront of transportation planning in the core of any urban area. As public and private sectors invest in city development, particularly in the high density and mixed-use central business districts, forecasting parking volumes for multiple facilities throughout urban transformation is critical to parking supply decision-making. Most previous studies have limitations that may yield inaccurate predictions and cannot precisely analyze the impact to area parking facilities, due to model simplicity and limited data accessibility. In order to provide accurate estimation with detailed information and account for technological improvements in data availability, this study provides an alternative method by utilizing an assignment model with a generalized cost approach. This enables more detailed information of forecasting parking volumes and assessing parking accessibility with consideration of shared parking and time-of-day distribution of parking demand. A case study was conducted in downtown Knoxville, Tennessee providing a sensitivity analysis for investigating the effects of parameters in the model. The sensitivity analysis includes parking generation rates, walking speed, and cruising time. Additionally, the results of three alternative scenarios are provided to show the advantages of this model to examine the impact of parking facility development on adjacent facilities. Manual adjustments and surveys may be required to apply this model for other cities, but it would provide more useful information for their (policymakers, developers, and planners) decision making.},

abstract = {While depth tends to improve network performances, it also makes gradient-based training more difficult since deeper networks tend to be more non-linear. The recently proposed knowledge distillation approach is aimed at obtaining small and fast-to-execute models, and it has shown that a student network could imitate the soft output of a larger teacher network or ensemble of networks. In this paper, we extend this idea to allow the training of a student that is deeper and thinner than the teacher, using not only the outputs but also the intermediate representations learned by the teacher as hints to improve the training process and final performance of the student. Because the student intermediate hidden layer will generally be smaller than the teacher's intermediate hidden layer, additional parameters are introduced to map the student hidden layer to the prediction of the teacher hidden layer. This allows one to train deeper students that can generalize better or run faster, a trade-off that is controlled by the chosen student capacity. For example, on CIFAR-10, a deep student network with almost 10.4 times less parameters outperforms a larger, state-of-the-art teacher network.},

This paper reports a simple and flexible method for increasing the activity and improving the properties of calcined natural calcites via a hydration-dehydration approach in order to make them highly suitable for biodiesel production. The ensuing transformations of the calcite during synthesis were monitored by XRD, TPD, BET, and SEM techniques. The characterization results indicate that this synthesis offers a new calcium oxide with less crystallinity. The new CaO has higher surface area and amount of basic sites than CaO generated from the decomposition of calcite. The calcination of calcite changed the pore shape of catalyst but the water treatment did not alter the pore characteristics of CaO. With these characteristics, our CaO exhibits higher catalytic activity than the decomposed calcite as observed from the transesterification of palm olein with methanol. The methyl ester content was enhanced to 93.9. wt.% from 75.5. wt.% of calcined calcite. This present study also provides new fundamental insight into the effect of water on properties and activity of CaO prepared by new hydration and subsequent thermal decomposition method of calcined calcite. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {While a diverse collection of continual learning (CL) methods has been proposed to prevent catastrophic forgetting, a thorough investigation of their effectiveness for processing sequential data with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is lacking. Here, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of established CL methods on a variety of sequential data benchmarks. Specifically, we shed light on the particularities that arise when applying weight-importance methods, such as elastic weight consolidation, to RNNs. In contrast to feedforward networks, RNNs iteratively reuse a shared set of weights and require working memory to process input samples. We show that the performance of weight-importance methods is not directly affected by the length of the processed sequences, but rather by high working memory requirements, which lead to an increased need for stability at the cost of decreased plasticity for learning subsequent tasks. We additionally provide theoretical arguments supporting this interpretation by studying linear RNNs. Our study shows that established CL methods can be successfully ported to the recurrent case, and that a recent regularization approach based on hypernetworks outperforms weight-importance methods, thus emerging as a promising candidate for CL in RNNs. Overall, we provide insights on the differences between CL in feedforward networks and RNNs, while guiding towards effective solutions to tackle CL on sequential data.},

abstract = {Foresters use light detection and ranging (lidar) data to understand the forest canopy and terrain, which helps them with forest management and operational activities. Combining lidar data with Esri{\textregistered} ArcGIS{\textregistered} helps analysts assess forest health, calculate forest biomass, classify terrain, identify drainage patterns, and plan forest management activities such as fertilization, harvesting programs, development activities, and more. This paper will step through processes to convert lidar data into a format ArcGIS can process, explain methods to interpret the lidar data, and show how ArcGIS can disseminate the data to those who are not geospatial analysts. It will present methods for reading raw classified lidar data and demonstrate methods for â  Analyzing and validating lidar data with ArcGIS before any extensive processing occurs â  Storing and managing millions or billions of lidar points within the geodatabase in a seamless dataset, regardless of the number of original lidar files â  Processing to extract digital elevation models (DEMs) and digital surface models (DSMs) from the lidar data and store them as terrains in a geodatabase or as raster elevation files â  Extracting vegetation density estimates and tree height estimates from lidar, which aid in growth analysis, fertilization regimes, and logging operations â  Serving and analyzing large amounts of lidar data as a seamless dataset to geographic information system (GIS) clients In all areas, ArcGIS is a complete system for managing, storing, and analyzing lidar data. Coupling ArcGIS Desktop with ArcGIS Server, the forestry professional is able to access large amounts of lidar data quickly and efficiently without the need to produce additional resultant datasets.},

abstract = {Active learning aims to reduce labeling costs by selecting only the most informative samples on a dataset. Few existing works have addressed active learning for object detection. Most of these methods are based on multiple models or are straightforward extensions of classification methods, hence estimate an image's informativeness using only the classification head. In this paper, we propose a novel deep active learning approach for object detection. Our approach relies on mixture density networks that estimate a probabilistic distribution for each localization and classification head's output. We explicitly estimate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass of a single model. Our method uses a scoring function that aggregates these two types of uncertainties for both heads to obtain every image's informativeness score. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets. Our approach outperforms single-model based methods and performs on par with multi-model based methods at a fraction of the computing cost.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with self-supervised learning for small models. The problem is motivated by our empirical studies that while the widely used contrastive self-supervised learning method has shown great progress on large model training, it does not work well for small models. To address this problem, we propose a new learning paradigm, named SElf-SupErvised Distillation (SEED), where we leverage a larger network (as Teacher) to transfer its representational knowledge into a smaller architecture (as Student) in a self-supervised fashion. Instead of directly learning from unlabeled data, we train a student encoder to mimic the similarity score distribution inferred by a teacher over a set of instances. We show that SEED dramatically boosts the performance of small networks on downstream tasks. Compared with self-supervised baselines, SEED improves the top-1 accuracy from 42.2% to 67.6% on EfficientNet-B0 and from 36.3% to 68.2% on MobileNet-v3-Large on the ImageNet-1k dataset.},

In this paper, we propose a learn-prune-share (LPS) algorithm which addresses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting, parsimony, and knowledge reuse simultaneously. LPS splits the network into task-specific partitions via an ADMM-based pruning strategy. This leads to no forgetting, while maintaining parsimony. Moreover, LPS integrates a novel selective knowledge sharing scheme into this ADMM optimization framework. This enables adaptive knowledge sharing in an end-to-end fashion. Comprehensive experimental results on two lifelong learning benchmark datasets and a challenging real-world radio frequency fingerprinting dataset are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our experiments show that LPS consistently outperforms multiple state-of-the-art competitors.},

The problem is especially acute when we need to consider artificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper we approach this problem in the following way: we take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. We then show how this formal definition is related to the theory of universal optimal learning agents. Finally, we survey the many other tests and definitions of intelligence that have been proposed for machines. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

To improve the discriminative power of zero-shot learning, we model the visual learning process of unseen categories with an inspiration from the psychology of human creativity for producing novel art. We relate ZSL to human creativity by observing that zero-shot learning is about recognizing the unseen and creativity is about creating a likable unseen. We introduce a learning signal inspired by creativity literature that explores the unseen space with hallucinated class-descriptions and encourages careful deviation of their visual feature generations from seen classes while allowing knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes. Empirically, we show consistent improvement over the state of the art of several percents on the largest available benchmarks on the challenging task or generalized ZSL from a noisy text that we focus on, using the CUB and NABirds datasets.

abstract = {Many recent research studies have proposed stem cell therapy as a treatment for cancer, spinal cord injuries, brain damage, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions. Some of these experimental therapies have been tested in small animals and, in rare cases, in humans. Medical researchers anticipate extensive clinical applications of stem cell therapy in the future. The lack of basic knowledge concerning basic stem cell biology-survival, migration, differentiation, integration in a real time manner when transplanted into damaged CNS remains an absolute bottleneck for attempt to design stem cell therapies for CNS diseases. A major challenge to the development of clinical applied stem cell therapy in medical practice remains the lack of efficient stem cell tracking methods. As a result, the fate of the vast majority of stem cells transplanted in the human central nervous system (CNS), particularly in the detrimental effects, remains unknown. The paucity of knowledge concerning basic stem cell biology--survival, migration, differentiation, integration in real-time when transplanted into damaged CNS remains a bottleneck in the attempt to design stem cell therapies for CNS diseases. Even though excellent histological techniques remain as the gold standard, no good in vivo techniques are currently available to assess the transplanted graft for migration, differentiation, or survival. To address these issues, herein we propose strategies to investigate the lineage fate determination of derived human embryonic stem cells (hESC) transplanted in vivo into the CNS. Here, we describe a comprehensive biological Global Positioning System (bGPS) to track transplanted stem cells. But, first, we review, four currently used standard methods for tracking stem cells in vivo: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bioluminescence imaging (BLI), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and fluorescence imaging (FLI) with quantum dots. We summarize these modalities and propose criteria that can be employed to rank the practical usefulness for specific applications. Based on the results of this review, we argue that additional qualities are still needed to advance these modalities toward clinical applications. We then discuss an ideal procedure for labeling and tracking stem cells in vivo, finally, we present a novel imaging system based on our experiments.},

abstract = {Dynamic near-infrared fluorescence (DNIF) whole-body imaging of small animals has become a popular tool in experimental biomedical research. In humans, however, the field of view has been limited to body parts, such as rheumatoid hands, diabetic feet or sentinel lymph nodes. Here we present a new whole-body DNIF-system suitable for adult subjects. We explored whether this system (i) allows dynamic whole-body fluorescence imaging and (ii) can detect modulations in skin perfusion. The non-specific fluorescent probe indocyanine green (ICG) was injected intravenously into two subjects, and fluorescence images were obtained at 5 Hz. The in- and out-flow kinetics of ICG have been shown to correlate with tissue perfusion. To validate the system, skin perfusion was modulated by warming and cooling distinct areas on the chest and the abdomen. Movies of fluorescence images show a bolus passage first in the face, then in the chest, abdomen and finally in the periphery ($\sim$10, 15, 20 and 30 seconds, respectively). When skin perfusion is augmented by warming, bolus arrives about 5 seconds earlier than when the skin is cooled and perfusion decreased. Calculating bolus arrival times and spatial fitting of basis time courses extracted from different regions of interest allowed a mapping of local differences in subcutaneous skin perfusion. This experiment is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of whole-body dynamic fluorescence imaging in humans. Since the whole-body approach demonstrates sensitivity to circumscribed alterations in skinperfusion, it may be used to target autonomous changes in polyneuropathy and to screen for peripheral vascular diseases.},

Although YOLOv2can achieve real-time performance on a powerful GPU, it still remainsvery challenging for leveraging this approach for real-timeobject detection in video on embedded computing devices withlimited computational power and limited memory. In this paper,we propose a new framework called Fast YOLO, a fast You OnlyLook Once framework which accelerates YOLOv2 to be able toperform object detection in video on embedded devices in a realtimemanner. First, we leverage the evolutionary deep intelligenceframework to evolve the YOLOv2 network architecture and producean optimized architecture (referred to as O-YOLOv2 here) that has2.8X fewer parameters with just a 2% IOU drop. To further reducepower consumption on embedded devices while maintaining performance,a motion-adaptive inference method is introduced intothe proposed Fast YOLO framework to reduce the frequency ofdeep inference with O-YOLOv2 based on temporal motion characteristics.Experimental results show that the proposed Fast YOLOframework can reduce the number of deep inferences by an averageof 38.13%, and an average speedup of 3.3X for objectiondetection in video compared to the original YOLOv2, leading FastYOLO to run an average of 18FPS on a Nvidia Jetson TX1 embeddedsystem.},

Contemporary incremental learning frameworks focus on image classification and object detection while in this work we formally introduce the incremental learning problem for semantic segmentation in which a pixel-wise labeling is considered. To tackle this task we propose to distill the knowledge of the previous model to retain the information about previously learned classes, whilst updating the current model to learn the new ones. We propose various approaches working both on the output logits and on intermediate features. In opposition to some recent frameworks, we do not store any image from previously learned classes and only the last model is needed to preserve high accuracy on these classes.

abstract = {Magneto-rheological visco-elastomer (MRVE) as a new smart material developed in recent years has several significant advantages over magneto-rheological liquid. The adjustability of structural dynamics to random environmental excitations is required in vibration control. MRVE can supply considerably adjustable damping and stiffness for structures, and the adjustment of dynamic properties is achieved only by applied magnetic fields with changeless structure design. Increasing researches on MRVE dynamic properties, modeling, and vibration control application are presented. Recent advances in MRVE dynamic properties and structural vibration control application including composite structural vibration mitigation under uniform magnetic fields, vibration response characteristics improvement through harmonic parameter distribution, and optimal bounded parametric control design based on the dynamical programming principle are reviewed. Relevant main methods and results introduced are beneficial to understanding and researches on MRVE application and development.},

abstract = {Seasonal Auto Regressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (SARFIMA) is a well-known model for forecasting of seasonal time series that follow a long memory process. However, to better boost the accuracy of forecasts inside such data for nonlinear problem, in this study, a combination of Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) with SARFIMA is proposed. To build the proposed model, certain parameters requires to be estimated. Therefore, a reliable Evolutionary Algorithm namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed. As a case study, a seasonal long memory time series, i.e., short term load consumption historical data, is selected. In fact, Short Term Load Forecasting (STLF) plays a key role in energy management systems (EMS) and in the decision making process of every power supply organization. In order to evaluate the proposed method, some experiments, using eight datasets of half-hourly load data from England and France for the year 2005 and four data sets of hourly load data from Malaysia for the year 2007, are designed. Although the focus of this research is STLF, six other seasonal long memory time series from several interesting case studies are employed to better evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results are compared with some novel FTS methods and new state-of-the-art forecasting methods. The analysis of the results indicates that the proposed method presents higher accuracy than its counterparts, representing an efficient hybrid method for load forecasting problems.},

abstract = {As the internet's footprint continues to expand, cybersecurity is becoming a major concern for both governments and the private sector. One such cybersecurity issue relates to data integrity attacks. This paper focuses on the power industry, where the forecasting processes rely heavily on the quality of the data. Data integrity attacks are expected to harm the performances of forecasting systems, which will have a major impact on both the financial bottom line of power companies and the resilience of power grids. This paper reveals the effect of data integrity attacks on the accuracy of four representative load forecasting models (multiple linear regression, support vector regression, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy interaction regression). We begin by simulating some data integrity attacks through the random injection of some multipliers that follow a normal or uniform distribution into the load series. Then, the four aforementioned load forecasting models are used to generate one-year-ahead ex post point forecasts in order to provide a comparison of their forecast errors. The results show that the support vector regression model is most robust, followed closely by the multiple linear regression model, while the fuzzy interaction regression model is the least robust of the four. Nevertheless, all four models fail to provide satisfying forecasts when the scale of the data integrity attacks becomes large. This presents a serious challenge to both load forecasters and the broader forecasting community: the generation of accurate forecasts under data integrity attacks. We construct our case study using the publicly-available data from Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012. At the end, we also offer an overview of potential research topics for future studies.},

Unlike homogeneous, heterogeneous catalysts are environmentally benign and could be operated in continuous processes. Moreover they can be reused and regenerated. However a high molar ratio of alcohol to oil, large amount of catalyst and high temperature and pressure are required when utilizing heterogeneous catalyst to produce biodiesel. In this paper, the catalytic activity of several solid base and acid catalysts, particularly metal oxides and supported metal oxides, was reviewed. Solid acid catalysts were able to do transesterification and esterification reactions simultaneously and convert oils with high amount of FFA (Free Fatty Acids). However, the reaction rate in the presence of solid base catalysts was faster. The catalyst efficiency depended on several factors such as specific surface area, pore size, pore volume and active site concentration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This is achieved by enforcing the convolution kernels to be near isometric during initialization and training, as well as by using a variant of ReLU that is shifted towards being isometric. Further experiments show that if combined with skip connections, such near isometric networks can achieve performances on par with (for ImageNet) and better than (for COCO) the standard ResNet, even without normalization at all.

abstract = {Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems. Also, conventional networks fix the architecture before training starts; as a result, training cannot improve the architecture. To address these limitations, we describe a method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections. Our method prunes redundant connections using a three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are important. Next, we prune the unimportant connections. Finally, we retrain the network to fine tune the weights of the remaining connections. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the number of parameters of AlexNet by a factor of 9Ã, from 61 million to 6.7 million, without incurring accuracy loss. Similar experiments with VGG-16 found that the total number of parameters can be reduced by 13Ã, from 138 million to 10.3 million, again with no loss of accuracy.},

Deep neural network architectures in image classification tasks struggle to disambiguate visually similar objects. Likewise, in human pose estimation symmetric body parts often confuse the network with assigning indiscriminative scores to them. This is due to the output prediction, in which only the highest confidence label is selected without taking into consideration a measure of uncertainty. In this work, we define the prediction difficulty as a relative property coming from the confidence score gap between positive and negative labels. More precisely, the proposed loss function penalizes the network to avoid the score of a false prediction being significant. To demonstrate the efficacy of our loss function, we evaluate it on two different domains: Image classification and human pose estimation. We find improvements in both applications by achieving higher accuracy compared to the baseline methods.},

Its input is a previously established model found by a clustering algorithm (subtractive algorithm in this case). Afterward, parameters of all Higher Order polynomials are adjusted using Recursive Least Square algorithm.

abstract = {For a long time the ability to solve abstract reasoning tasks was considered one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. Recent advances in application of deep learning (DL) methods led, as in many other domains, to surpassing human abstract reasoning performance, specifically in the most popular type of such problems - the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs). While the efficacy of DL systems is indeed impressive, the way they approach the RPMs is very different from that of humans. State-of-the-art systems solving RPMs rely on massive pattern-based training and sometimes on exploiting biases in the dataset, whereas humans concentrate on identification of the rules / concepts underlying the RPM (or generally a visual reasoning task) to be solved. Motivated by this cognitive difference, this work aims at combining DL with human way of solving RPMs and getting the best of both worlds. Specifically, we cast the problem of solving RPMs into multi-label classification framework where each RPM is viewed as a multi-label data point, with labels determined by the set of abstract rules underlying the RPM. For efficient training of the system we introduce a generalisation of the Noise Contrastive Estimation algorithm to the case of multi-label samples. Furthermore, we propose a new sparse rule encoding scheme for RPMs which, besides the new training algorithm, is the key factor contributing to the state-of-the-art performance. The proposed approach is evaluated on two most popular benchmark datasets (Balanced-RAVEN and PGM) and on both of them demonstrates an advantage over the current state-of-the-art results. Contrary to applications of contrastive learning methods reported in other domains, the state-of-the-art performance reported in the paper is achieved with no need for large batch sizes or strong data augmentation.},

For fast object feature extraction, we advocate the use of statistics of local point cloud properties, captured by histograms over point features. In contrast to most existing work on 3D point cloud classification, where real-time operation is often impossible, this combination allows our system to perform in real-time at 0.1s frame-rate.},

abstract = {Online continual learning is a challenging scenario where a model needs to learn 1 from a continuous stream of data without revisiting any previously encountered 2 data instances. The phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting is worsened since the 3 model should not only address the forgetting at the task-level but also at the data 4 instance-level within the same task. To mitigate this, we leverage the concept of 5 "instance awareness" in the neural network, where each data instance is classified 6 by a path in the network searched by the controller from a meta-graph. To preserve 7 the knowledge we learn from previous instances, we proposed a method to protect 8 the path by restricting the gradient updates of one instance from overriding past 9 updates calculated from previous instances if these instances are not similar.

abstract = {Human memory is strikingly susceptible to social influences, yet we know little about the underlying mechanisms. We examined how socially induced memory errors are generated in the brain by studying the memory of individuals exposed to recollections of others. Participants exhibited a strong tendency to conform to erroneous recollections of the group, producing both long-lasting and temporary errors, even when their initial memory was strong and accurate. Functional brain imaging revealed that social influence modified the neuronal representation of memory. Specifically, a particular brain signature of enhanced amygdala activity and enhanced amygdala-hippocampus connectivity predicted long-lasting but not temporary memory alterations. Our findings reveal how social manipulation can alter memory and extend the known functions of the amygdala to encompass socially mediated memory distortions.},

In particular, we investigate generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the task of learning new categories in a sequential fashion. We first show that sequential fine tuning renders the network unable to properly generate images from previous categories (i.e. forgetting). Addressing this problem, we propose Memory Replay GANs (MeRGANs), a conditional GAN framework that integrates a memory replay generator. We study two methods to prevent forgetting by leveraging these replays, namely joint training with replay and replay alignment. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results in MNIST, SVHN and LSUN datasets show that our memory replay approach can generate competitive images while significantly mitigating the forgetting of previous categories. 1.},

The facility-in-L2 tests are designed to measure receptive and productive language ability as test-takers engage in a succession of tasks with meaningful language. Concurrent validity studies indicate that scores from the automated tests are strongly correlated with the scores from oral proficiency interviews. In separate studies with learners from each of the four languages the automated tests predict scores from the live interview tests as well as those tests predict themselves in a test-retest protocol (r = 0.77 to 0.92). Although it might be assumed that the interactive nature of the oral interview elicits performances that manifest a distinct construct, the closeness of the results suggests that the constructs underlying the two approaches to oral assessment have a stable relationship across languages.},

It has kindled research and the development of technologies in emulating biological electricity for tissue regeneration. Promising effects of electrical stimulation on cell growth and differentiation and tissue growth has led to interest in using piezoelectric scaffolds for tissue repair. Piezoelectric materials can generate electrical activity when deformed. Hence, an external source to apply electrical stimulation or implantation of electrodes is not needed. Various piezoelectric materials have been employed for different tissue repair applications, particularly in bone repair, where charges induced by mechanical stress can enhance bone formation; and in neural tissue engineering, in which electric pulses can stimulate neurite directional outgrowth to fill gaps in nervous tissue injuries. In this review, a summary of piezoelectricity in different biological tissues, mechanisms through which electrical stimulation may affect cellular response, and recent advances in the fabrication and application of piezoelectric scaffolds will be discussed. Statement of Significance The discovery of piezoelectricity, endogenous electric fields and transmembrane potentials in biological tissues has kindled research and the development of technologies using electrical stimulation for tissue regeneration. Piezoelectric materials generate electrical activity in response to deformations and allow for the delivery of an electrical stimulus without the need for an external power source. As a scaffold for tissue engineering, growing interest exists due to its potential of providing electrical stimulation to cells to promote tissue formation. In this review, we cover the discovery of piezoelectricity in biological tissues, its connection to streaming potentials, biological response to electrical stimulation and commonly used piezoelectric materials for tissue regeneration.

abstract = {Independent Components Analysis (ICA) and its variants have been successfully used for unsupervised feature learning. However, standard ICA requires an orthonoramlity constraint to be enforced, which makes it difficult to learn overcomplete features. In addition, ICA is sensitive to whitening. These properties make it challenging to scale ICA to high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a robust soft reconstruction cost for ICA that allows us to learn highly overcomplete sparse features even on unwhitened data. Our formulation reveals formal connections between ICA and sparse autoencoders, which have previously been observed only empirically. Our algorithm can be used in conjunction with off-the-shelf fast unconstrained optimizers. We show that the soft reconstruction cost can also be used to prevent replicated features in tiled convolutional neural networks. Using our method to learn highly overcomplete sparse features and tiled convolutional neural networks, we obtain competitive performances on a wide variety of object recognition tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art test accuracies on the STL-10 and Hollywood2 datasets.},

abstract = {The mitotic cells from an asynchronous population of Chinese hamster ovary cells exposed to 41.5 degrees for 7 hr were examined by light and electron microscopy to determine if there were any morphological abnormalities related to cell death or lengthening of metaphase induced by hyperthermia. All components of the mitotic apparatus were formed during exposure to heat, and the mitotic apparatus was functional as demonstrated by eventual cell division. However, heat caused the nuclear envelope to reform precociously around the chromosomes except in the region of the kinetochores, and the nuclear envelope remained associated with the chromatids during segregation. The precocious reformation of the nuclear envelope may be responsible for the lengthening of metaphase. Cells undergoing mitosis during the heat treatment possessed large evaginations of the plasma membrane, and the ubiquitous cortical microfilaments were absent in the region of these evaginations. Possibly related to the membrane damage were osmotic changes resulting in swollen mitochondria observed in heated cells entering mitosis. Since hyperthermic damage to the plasma membrane-microfilament complex was not observed in interphase cells or in cells completing division but was morphologically expressed during mitosis, the thermal lability of the plasma membrane must increase as the cells enter mitosis.},

After laying this foundation, the book applies the methodologies to classical problems in combinatorial optimization, computational geometry, and graph problems. In addition, it explores large-scale and emerging applications in networks, bioinformatics, VLSI, game theory, and data analysis. Undoubtedly sparking further developments in the field, this handbook provides the essential techniques to apply approximation algorithms and metaheuristics to a wide range of problems in computer science, operations research, computer engineering, and economics.

abstract = {This paper is an extensive review of the research that has been undertaken on near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy applied to soil particularly for determining carbon (C) content. The objective is to determine which acquisition method (NIR, MIR, in the field or in the laboratory) might be recommended for the purpose of C stock measurement with a particular interest in carbon credit trading. For this purpose, an optimal method has to satisfy the dual constraints of low-cost and high throughput analysis. The various methods proposed in the literature are compared. In order to make comparisons as reliable as possible, special attention has been paid to the conditions of data acquisition (sample preparation), and to calibration and validation procedures. In particular, whether the validation has been carried out on fully independent samples or on samples similar to the ones of the calibration set greatly influences the results. Also, for C stock measurement, it is absolutely necessary to measure the bias of the prediction in order to be conclusive about the feasibility of the method. However, only few researchers provide this parameter and we recommend including it as a matter of course in future reports. Finally, although MIR on dried and ground samples is the most accurate method, on-the-go and in-field sensors provide predictions accurate enough to show promise in being a valuable component of technologies that would be used for C-credit purposes. But in order to meet the cost/accuracy trade-off, the main issue using such field sensors is to be able to simultaneously measure the bulk density or, better, to directly measure the volumetric concentration of C in soil. This circumvents the costs of field extraction and laboratory analysis. This is the next great challenge to be met by soil scientists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The human vision and perception system is inherently incremental where new knowledge is continually learned over time whilst existing knowledge is retained. On the other hand, deep learning networks are ill-equipped for incremental learning. When a well-trained network is adapted to new categories, its performance on the old categories will dramatically degrade. To address this problem, incremental learning methods have been explored which preserve the old knowledge of deep learning models. However, the state-of-the-art incremental object detector employs an external fixed region proposal method that increases overall computation time and reduces accuracy comparing to Region Proposal Network (RPN) based object detectors such as Faster RCNN. The purpose of this paper is to design an efficient end-to-end incremental object detector using knowledge distillation. We first evaluate and analyze the performance of the RPN-based detector with classic distillation on incremental detection tasks. Then, we introduce multi-network adaptive distillation that properly retains knowledge from the old categories when fine-tuning the model for new task. Experiments on the benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and COCO, demonstrate that the proposed incremental detector based on Faster RCNN is more accurate as well as being 13 times faster than the baseline detector.},

abstract = {High-content screening is commonly used in studies of the DNA damage response. The double-strand break (DSB) is one of the most harmful types of DNA damage lesions. The conventional method used to quantify DSBs is $\gamma$H2AX foci counting, which requires manual adjustment and preset parameters and is usually regarded as imprecise, time-consuming, poorly reproducible, and inaccurate. Therefore, a robust automatic alternative method is highly desired. In this manuscript, we present a new method for quantifying DSBs which involves automatic image cropping, automatic foci-segmentation and fluorescent intensity measurement. Furthermore, an additional function was added for standardizing the measurement of DSB response inhibition based on co-localization analysis. We tested the method with a well-known inhibitor of DSB response. The new method requires only one preset parameter, which effectively minimizes operator-dependent variations. Compared with conventional methods, the new method detected a higher percentage difference of foci formation between different cells, which can improve measurement accuracy. The effects of the inhibitor on DSB response were successfully quantified with the new method (pâ=â0.000). The advantages of this method in terms of reliability, automation and simplicity show its potential in quantitative fluorescence imaging studies and high-content screening for compounds and factors involved in DSB response.},

abstract = {Multi-task learns multiple tasks, while sharing knowledge and computation among them. However, it suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge when learned incrementally without access to the old data. Most existing object detectors are domain-specific and static, while some are learned incrementally but only within a single domain. Training an object detector incrementally across various domains has rarely been explored. In this work, we propose three incremental learning scenarios across various domains and categories for object detection. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, attentive feature distillation is proposed to leverages both bottom-up and top-down attentions to extract important information for distillation. We then systematically analyze the proposed distillation method in different scenarios. We find out that, contrary to common understanding, domain gaps have smaller negative impact on incremental detection, while category differences are problematic. For the difficult cases, where the domain gaps and especially category differences are large, we explore three different exemplar sampling methods and show the proposed adaptive sampling method is effective to select diverse and informative samples from entire datasets, to further prevent forgetting. Experimental results show that we achieve the significant improvement in three different scenarios across seven object detection benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {Accurately forecasting crop yield in advance of harvest could greatly benefit decision makers when making management decisions. However, few evaluations have been conducted to determine the impact of including weather forecasts, as opposed to using historical weather data (commonly used) in crop models. We tested a combination of short-term weather forecasts from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) to predict in season weather variables, such as, maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and radiation at four different forecast lengths (14 days, 7 days, 3 days, and 0 days). This forecasted weather data along with the current and historic (previous 35 years) data were combined to drive Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) in-season corn [Zea mays L] and soybean [Glycine max] grain yield and phenology forecasts for 16 field trials in Iowa, USA. The overall goal was to determine how the inclusion of weather forecasting impacts in-season crop model predictions. We had two objectives 1) determine the impact of weather forecast length on WRF accuracy, and 2) quantify the impact of weather forecasts accuracy on APSIM prediction accuracy. We found that the most accurate weather forecast length varied greatly among the 16 treatments (2 years Ã 2 sites Ã 2 crops Ã 2 management practices), but that the 0 day and 3 day forecasts were, on average, the most accurate when compared to the other forecast lengths. Overall, the accuracy of the in-season crop yield forecast was inversely proportional to forecast length (p = 0.026), but there was variation among treatments. The accuracy of the in-season flowering and maturity forecasts were not significantly affected by inclusion of weather forecast length (p = 0.065). The 14 day forecast provided enough lead time to improve flowering prediction in 8 out of the 16 treatments. The fact that maximum temperature was the most accurate predicted variable by WRF was the reason for improvements in flowering predictions. Our results suggest that a weather forecast from WRF was not better than historical weather for yield prediction.},

We use this case to examine drawbacks for the defense when the presentation of scientific evidence is partial, especially when the only perspective mentioned is that of the prosecution. We tackle this discussion at two distinct levels. First, we pursue an essentially non-technical presentation of the topic by drawing parallels between the court's summing up of the case and flawed patterns of reasoning commonly seen in other forensic disciplines, such as DNA and particle traces (e.g., gunshot residues). Then, we propose a formal analysis of the case, using elements of probability and graphical probability models, to justify our main claim that the partial presentation of digital evidence poses a risk to the administration of justice in that it keeps vital information from the defense. We will argue that such practice constitutes a violation of general principles of forensic interpretation as established by forensic science literature and current recommendations by forensic science interest groups (e.g., the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). Finally, we posit that argument construction and analysis using formal methods can help replace digital evidence appropriately into context and thus support a sound evaluation of the evidence.},

Here we use image representations derived from Convolutional Neural Networks optimised for object recognition, which make high level image information explicit. We introduce A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The algorithm allows us to produce new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of an arbitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous wellknown artworks.

abstract = {Most existing machine learning classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify it. In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model. Up to now, all previous work has assumed a threat model in which the adversary can feed data directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always the case for systems operating in the physical world, for example those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as input. This paper shows that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples. We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial images obtained from a cell-phone camera to an ImageNet Inception classifier and measuring the classification accuracy of the system. We find that a large fraction of adversarial examples are classified incorrectly even when perceived through the camera.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of an agent or a team of agents searching for a resource or tangible good in a physical environment, where the resource or good may possibly be obtained at one of several locations. The cost of acquiring the resource or good at a given location is uncertain (a priori), and the agents can observe the true cost only when physically arriving at this location. Sample applications include agents in exploration and patrol missions (e.g., an agent seeking to find the best location to deploy sensing equipment along its path). The uniqueness of these settings is in that the cost of observing a new location is determined by distance from the current one, impacting the consideration for the optimal search order. Although this model captures many real world scenarios, it has not been investigated so far. We analyze three variants of the problem, differing in their objective: minimizing the total expected cost, maximizing the success probability given an initial budget, and minimizing the budget necessary to obtain a given success probability. For each variant, we first introduce and analyze the problem with a single agent, either providing a polynomial solution to the problem or proving it is NP-complete. We also introduce a fully polynomial time approximation scheme algorithm for the minimum budget variant. In the multi-agent case, we analyze two models for managing resources, shared and private budget models. We present polynomial algorithms that work for any fixed number of agents, in the shared or private budget model. For non-communicating agents in the private budget model, we present a polynomial algorithm that is suitable for any number of agents. We also analyze the difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous agents, both with respect to their allotted resources and with respect to their capabilities. Finally, we define our problem in an environment with self-interested agents. We show how to find a Nash equilibrium in polynomial time, and prove that the bound on the performance of our algorithms, with respect to the social welfare, is tight. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

First, the motivation, general pipeline, and terminologies of this field are described. Then the common deep neural network architectures that used for self-supervised learning are summarized. Next, the main components and evaluation metrics of self-supervised learning methods are reviewed followed by the commonly used image and video datasets and the existing self-supervised visual feature learning methods. Finally, quantitative performance comparisons of the reviewed methods on benchmark datasets are summarized and discussed for both image and video feature learning.

abstract = {Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and transfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.},

abstract = {A major obstacle to developing artificial intelligence applications capable of true lifelong learning is that artificial neural networks quickly or catastrophically forget previously learned tasks when trained on a new one. Numerous methods for alleviating catastrophic forgetting are currently being proposed, but differences in evaluation protocols make it difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more meaningful comparisons, here we identified three distinct scenarios for continual learning based on whether task identity is known and, if it is not, whether it needs to be inferred. Performing the split and permuted MNIST task protocols according to each of these scenarios, we found that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) failed when task identity needed to be inferred. In contrast, generative replay combined with distillation (i.e., using class probabilities as "soft targets") achieved superior performance in all three scenarios. Addressing the issue of efficiency, we reduced the computational cost of generative replay by integrating the generative model into the main model by equipping it with generative feedback or backward connections. This Replay-through-Feedback approach substantially shortened training time with no or negligible loss in performance. We believe this to be an important first step towards making the powerful technique of generative replay scalable to real-world continual learning applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of fine-grained image retrieval in an incremental setting, when new categories are added over time. On the one hand, repeatedly training the representation on the extended dataset is time-consuming. On the other hand, fine-tuning the learned representation only with the new classes leads to catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we propose an incremental learning method to mitigate retrieval performance degradation caused by the forgetting issue. Without accessing any samples of the original classes, the classifier of the original network provides soft âlabelsâ to transfer knowledge to train the adaptive network, so as to preserve the previous capability for classification. More importantly, a regularization function based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy is devised to minimize the discrepancy of new classes features from the original network and the adaptive network, respectively. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that our method effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting on the original classes while achieving high performance on the new classes.},

To generate images with artifacts, we pre-train a high-capacity autoencoder and then we use a damage and repair strategy: First, we freeze the autoencoder and damage the output of the encoder by randomly dropping its entries. Second, we augment the decoder with a repair network, and train it in an adversarial manner against the discriminator. The repair network helps generate more realistic images by inpainting the dropped feature entries. To make the discriminator focus on the artifacts, we also make it predict what entries in the feature were dropped. We demonstrate experimentally that features learned by creating and spotting artifacts achieve state of the art performance in several benchmarks.},

This work refines the GLSC histogram by embedding HVNC into GLSC histogram. To select threshold based on the redefined GLSC histogram, we employ the type-2 fuzzy set, whose membership function integrates the effect of pixel gray value and local spatial information to membership value. The type-2 fuzzy set is subsequently transformed into a type-1 fuzzy set for fuzziness measure computation via type reduction. Finally, the optimal threshold is obtained by minimizing the fuzziness of the type-1 fuzzy set after an exhaustive search. The experiment on different types of images demonstrates the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed thresholding technique.},

Most approaches trying to mitigate cruising on the street use price to manage demand. Here, an online system of curb parking space reservations is proposed. Reservations eliminate the uncertainties that lead to cruising, and by designing the system within the new paradigm of parking planning and management, transport policy objectives of equity and sustainability can be pursued. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a case study in Lisbon was conducted. Firstly, cruising for parking was assessed, and showed a daily average of 10% of observed traffic to be cruising, in an area with several transit alternatives. Then, potential demand for the reservations service was also addressed. Next, a model of traffic and cruising behavior was developed and calibrated with the observed data, and a stochastic discrete-event micro-simulator was implemented and validated. Finally, simulations were used to compare scenarios of variable allocation of parking spaces to reservations. The results show a statistically significant reduction of total travel time of up to 3% of the value without reservations.},

abstract = {Interpretability of classification systems, which refers to the ability of these systems to express their behavior in an understandable way, has recently gained more attention and it is considered as an important requirement especially for knowledge-based systems. The main objective of this study is to improve the ability of a well-known fuzzy classifier proposed in Ishibuchi and Nojima (2007) to maximize the accuracy while preserve its interpretability. To achieve the above-mentioned objective, we propose two variants of the original fuzzy classifier. In the first variant classifier, the same components of the original classifier were used except NSGA-II which was replaced by an enhanced version called Controlled Elitism NSGA-II. This replacement aims at improving the ability of the first variant classifier to find non-dominated solutions with better interpretability-accuracy trade-off. In the second variant classifier, we further improve the first variant classifier by enhancing the selection method of the antecedent conditions of the rules generated in the initial population of genetic algorithm. Unlike the method applied in the original classifier and the first variant classifier, which uses a random selection of the antecedent conditions, we proposed a feature-based selection method to favor the antecedent conditions associated with the most relevant features. The results show that the two variant classifiers find more non-dominated fuzzy rule-based systems with better generalization ability than the original method which suggests that Controlled Elitism NSGA-II algorithm is more efficient than NSGA-II. In addition, feature-based selection method applied in the second variant classifier allowed this method to successfully obtain high-quality solutions as it has consistently achieved the best error rates for all the data sets compared to the original method and the first variant classifier.},

abstract = {Recognition tasks, such as object recognition and keypoint estimation, have seen widespread adoption in recent years. Most state-of-the-art methods for these tasks use deep networks that are computationally expensive and have huge memory footprints. This makes it exceedingly difficult to deploy these systems on low power embedded devices. Hence, the importance of decreasing the storage requirements and the amount of computation in such models is paramount. The recently proposed Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) states that deep neural networks trained on large datasets contain smaller subnetworks that achieve on par performance as the dense networks. In this work, we perform the first empirical study investigating LTH for model pruning in the context of object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint estimation. Our studies reveal that lottery tickets obtained from ImageNet pretraining do not transfer well to the downstream tasks. We provide guidance on how to find lottery tickets with up to 80% overall sparsity on different sub-tasks without incurring any drop in the performance. Finally, we analyse the behavior of trained tickets with respect to various task attributes such as object size, frequency, and difficulty of detection.},

abstract = {Few-layer black phosphorus (BP), as the most alluring graphene analogue owing to its similar structure as graphene and thickness dependent direct band-gap, has now triggered a new wave of research on two-dimensional (2D) materials based photonics and optoelectronics. However, a major obstacle of practical applications for few-layer BPs comes from their instabilities of laser-induced optical damage. Herein, we demonstrate that, few-layer BPs, fabricated through the liquid exfoliation approach, can be developed as a new and practical saturable absorber (SA) by depositing few-layer BPs with microfiber. The saturable absorption property of few-layer BPs had been verified through an open-aperture z-scan measurement at the telecommunication band and the microfiber-based BP device had been found to show a saturable average power of $\sim$4.5 mW and a modulation depth of 10.9%, which is further confirmed through a balanced twin detection measurement. By further integrating this optical SA device into an erbium-doped fiber laser, it was found that it can deliver the mode-locked pulse with duration down to 940 fs with central wavelength tunable from 1532 nm to 1570 nm. The prevention of BP from oxidation through the 'lateral interaction scheme' owing to this microfiber-based few-layer BP SA device might partially mitigate the optical damage problem of BP. Our results not only demonstrate that black phosphorus might be another promising SA material for ultrafast photonics, but also provide a practical solution to solve the optical damage problem of black phosphorus by assembling with waveguide structures such as microfiber.},

abstract = {Continual (sequential) training and multitask (simultaneous) training are often attempting to solve the same overall objective: to find a solution that performs well on all considered tasks. The main difference is in the training regimes, where continual learning can only have access to one task at a time, which for neural networks typically leads to catastrophic forgetting. That is, the solution found for a subsequent task does not perform well on the previous ones anymore. However, the relationship between the different minima that the two training regimes arrive at is not well understood. What sets them apart? Is there a local structure that could explain the difference in performance achieved by the two different schemes? Motivated by recent work showing that different minima of the same task are typically connected by very simple curves of low error, we investigate whether multitask and continual solutions are similarly connected. We empirically find that indeed such connectivity can be reliably achieved and, more interestingly, it can be done by a linear path, conditioned on having the same initialization for both. We thoroughly analyze this observation and discuss its significance for the continual learning process. Furthermore, we exploit this finding to propose an effective algorithm that constrains the sequentially learned minima to behave as the multitask solution. We show that our method outperforms several state of the art continual learning algorithms on various vision benchmarks1},

The NIR showed worse predictions than MIR for almost all FA, when expressed as g/kg of milk. The NIR predictions on fresh liquid and oven-dried milk were similar, but the reliability decreased for thawed liquid milk.

abstract = {The classical view of neural coding has emphasized the importance of information carried by the rate at which neurons discharge action potentials. More recent proposals that information may be carried by precise spike timing have been challenged by the assumption that these neurons operate in a noisy fashion - presumably reflecting fluctuations in synaptic input and, thus, incapable of transmitting signals with millisecond fidelity. Here we show that precisely synchronized action potentials can propagate within a model of cortical network activity that recapitulates many of the features of biological systems. An attractor, yielding a stable spiking precision in the (sub)millisecond range, governs the dynamics of synchronization. Our results indicate that a combinatorial neural code, based on rapid associations of groups of neurons co-ordinating their activity at the single spike level, is possible within a cortical-like network.},

abstract = {Effective training of deep neural networks can be challenging, and there remain many open questions on how to best learn these models. Recently developed methods to improve neural network training examine teaching: providing learned information during the training process to improve downstream model performance. In this paper, we take steps towards extending the scope of teaching. We propose a flexible teaching framework using commentaries, meta-learned information helpful for training on a particular task or dataset. We present an efficient and scalable gradient-based method to learn commentaries, leveraging recent work on implicit differentiation. We explore diverse applications of commentaries, from learning weights for individual training examples, to parameterizing label-dependent data augmentation policies, to representing attention masks that highlight salient image regions. In these settings, we find that commentaries can improve training speed and/or performance and also provide fundamental insights about the dataset and training process.},

abstract = {Self-supervised representation learning approaches have recently surpassed their supervised learning counterparts on downstream tasks like object detection and image classification. Somewhat mysteriously the recent gains in performance come from training instance classification models, treating each image and it's augmented versions as samples of a single class. In this work, we first present quantitative experiments to demystify these gains. We demonstrate that approaches like MOCO[1] and PIRL[2] learn occlusion-invariant representations. However, they fail to capture viewpoint and category instance invariance which are crucial components for object recognition. Second, we demonstrate that these approaches obtain further gains from access to a clean object-centric training dataset like Imagenet. Finally, we propose an approach to leverage unstructured videos to learn representations that possess higher viewpoint invariance. Our results show that the learned representations outperform MOCOv2 trained on the same data in terms of invariances encoded and the performance on downstream image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.},

Time Series refers an ordered sequence of values of a variable at equally spaced time intervals. Time series occur frequently when looking at agricultural data applications. The analysis was carried out using time series data on the supply of fresh vegetables during the period from 2002 to 2011 which was collected from the office of the Deputy Directorate of Agri-business situated at Madurai, India. The analysis of monthly supply and price of vegetables data was used to find out seasonal pattern. The seasonal index for vegetable supply was highest in March and April and was lower in the November and December. The seasonal variation in vegetables price was high in the period of November to January and price low in March. It was further inferred that forecast value for the supply of fresh brinjal , Bhendi and Green Chilly was low in January'13 and it was high in December for these vegetables whereas in the forecasted value for the supply of fresh tomato and green chilly variations were found. The study suggested that cold storage capacities may be developed in the needy places to increase the benefits of consumers and farmers to increase the efficiency of Supply Chain Management.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient method for approximating natural gradient descent in neural networks which we call Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). K-FAC is based on an efficiently invertible approximation of a neural network's Fisher information matrix which is neither diagonal nor low-rank, and in some cases is completely non-sparse. It is derived by approximating various large blocks of the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker product of two much smaller matrices. While only several times more expensive to compute than the plain stochastic gradient, the updates produced by K-FAC make much more progress optimizing the objective, which results in an algorithm that can be much faster than stochastic gradient descent with momentum in practice. And unlike some previously proposed approximate natural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal curvature matrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in highly stochastic optimization regimes. This is because the cost of storing and inverting K-FAC's approximation to the curvature matrix does not depend on the amount of data used to estimate it, which is a feature typically associated only with diagonal or low-rank approximations to the curvature matrix.},

Accordingly, the present study aims to apply a hybrid intelligent approach named ADEâBPNN, the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model supported by an adaptive differential evolution algorithm, to estimate energy consumption. Most often, energy consumption is influenced by socioeconomic factors. The proposed hybrid model incorporates gross domestic product, population, import, and export data as inputs. An improved differential evolution with adaptive mutation and crossover is utilized to find appropriate global initial connection weights and thresholds to enhance the forecasting performance of the BPNN. A comparative example and two extended examples are utilized to validate the applicability and accuracy of the proposed ADEâBPNN model. Errors of the test data sets indicate that the ADEâBPNN model can effectively predict energy consumption compared with the traditional back-propagation neural network model and other popular existing models. Moreover, mean impact value based analysis is conducted for electrical energy consumption in U.S. and total energy consumption forecasting in China to quantitatively explore the relative importance of each input variable for the improvement of effective energy consumption prediction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction methods are increasingly used in biosciences to forecast diverse features and characteristics. Binary two-state classifiers are the most common applications. They are usually based on machine learning approaches. For the end user it is often problematic to evaluate the true performance and applicability of computational tools as some knowledge about computer science and statistics would be needed.\n\nRESULTS: Instructions are given on how to interpret and compare method evaluation results. For systematic method performance analysis is needed established benchmark datasets which contain cases with known outcome, and suitable evaluation measures. The criteria for benchmark datasets are discussed along with their implementation in VariBench, benchmark database for variations. There is no single measure that alone could describe all the aspects of method performance. Predictions of genetic variation effects on DNA, RNA and protein level are important as information about variants can be produced much faster than their disease relevance can be experimentally verified. Therefore numerous prediction tools have been developed, however, systematic analyses of their performance and comparison have just started to emerge.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The end users of prediction tools should be able to understand how evaluation is done and how to interpret the results. Six main performance evaluation measures are introduced. These include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient. Together with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis they provide a good picture about the performance of methods and allow their objective and quantitative comparison. A checklist of items to look at is provided. Comparisons of methods for missense variant tolerance, protein stability changes due to amino acid substitutions, and effects of variations on mRNA splicing are presented.},

Weather nowcasting is a short-range forecasting that maps current weather, then uses an estimation of its speed and direction of movement to forecast weather in a short period ahead -Assuming the weather will move without significant changes. It operates through latest radar, satellite or observational data. However, flawed characterization of transitions between different meteorological structures is its main challenges. In this paper, an innovative method for weather nowcasting from satellite image sequences using the combination of picture fuzzy clustering and interpolative fuzzy rules is proposed. Firstly, picture fuzzy clustering algorithm, a fuzzy clustering method based on the theory of picture fuzzy set, is used to partition the satellite image pixels into clusters. Secondly, the interpolative trapezoidal picture fuzzy rules are created from the clusters. Finally, particle swarm optimization is employed to train the defuzzified parameter from the rules to enhance the accuracy of the predicted satellite images in sequence. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is better than the relevant ones for weather nowcasting.},

abstract = {With the memory-resource-limited constraints, class-incremental learning (CIL) usually suffers from the âcatastrophic forgettingâ problem when updating the joint classification model on the arrival of newly added classes. To cope with the forgetting problem, many CIL methods transfer the knowledge of old classes by preserving some exemplar samples into the size-constrained memory buffer. To utilize the memory buffer more efficiently, we propose to keep more auxiliary low-fidelity exemplar samples rather than the original real high-fidelity exemplar samples. Such memory-efficient exemplar preserving scheme make the old-class knowledge transfer more effective. However, the low-fidelity exemplar samples are often distributed in a different domain away from that of the original exemplar samples, that is, a domain shift. To alleviate this problem, we propose a duplet learning scheme that seeks to construct domain-compatible feature extractors and classifiers, which greatly narrows down the above domain gap. As a result, these low-fidelity auxiliary exemplar samples have the ability to moderately replace the original exemplar samples with a lower memory cost. In addition, we present a robust classifier adaptation scheme, which further refines the biased classifier (learned with the samples containing distillation label knowledge about old classes) with the help of the samples of pure true class labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this work against the state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the code, baselines, and training statistics for all models to facilitate future research.},

The major disadvantage of the TRBM is that exact inference is extremely hard, since even computing a Gibbs update for a single variable of the posterior is exponentially expensive. This difficulty has necessitated the use of a heuristic inference procedure, that nonetheless was accurate enough for successful learning. In this paper we introduce the Recurrent TRBM, which is a very slight modification of the TRBM for which exact inference is very easy and exact gradient learning is almost tractable.

abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) power systems have been widely applied in commercial and domestic facilities. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) systems are mandatory in standalone PV systems for continuous power supply. In this paper the efficiency and robustness enhancement methods for PV systems under partial shading have been investigated. Partial shading due to moving clouds and shadows of nearby obstacles on the PV module array causes significant efficiency degradation, since shaded and non-shaded PV modules have large discrepancy in their maximum power points. Use of by-pass diodes for each PV module may mitigate the negative effect from partial shading. However, this method alone may still face severe energy efficiency degradation caused by the energy loss due to parasitic effects in the EES elements under variable incoming power from the PV modules. Hence, this paper investigates the effect of shading on photovoltaic cells.},

abstract = {This study adopts intraday return instead of daily return used by previous researches to examine the effect of order imbalance not only on the individual stock return but also volatility among jump losers. We also build up order imbalance-based trading strategies to earn abnormal return.  A contemporaneous order imbalance-return relation is examined by GARCH (1,1) model and time-series regression model. The data presents significantly positive relation in both models as previous studies on daily reurn. We focus on the lagged effect of imbalance on return and find that such relation is negatively significant, while contemporaneous imbalance has positive significant impact on return. We examine the volatility-order imbalance relationship by a time-varying GARCH (1,1) model. The positive relation of volatility and order imbalance is consistent with our ex ante expectatio n that larger imbalance make s return more volatile. Then, the small firm effect shows the weakly negative relation between order imbalance coefficient and market capitalization.  We develop two order imbalance-based trading strategies based on different definitions of price: trading price and bid-ask. Due to the characteristics of our jump losers, we use short selling strategy. Our results show the huge profitability of order imbalance strategies when we trade on extreme volume.  In order to explore the reason of profitable order imbalance based strategy, we investigate the causal relationship between return and order imbalance. We find that order imbalance is a good indicator of price discovery. Moreover, order imbalance apparently is an excellent indicator for return prediction in small firm size quartile.},

abstract = {High demand for computation resources severely hinders deployment of large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in resource constrained devices. In this work, we propose a Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) method to regularize the structures (i.e., filters, channels, filter shapes, and layer depth) of DNNs. SSL can: (1) learn a compact structure from a bigger DNN to reduce computation cost; (2) obtain a hardware-friendly structured sparsity of DNN to efficiently accelerate the DNN's evaluation. Experimental results show that SSL achieves on average 5.1Ã and 3.1Ã speedups of convolutional layer computation of AlexNet against CPU and GPU, respectively, with off-the-shelf libraries. These speedups are about twice speedups of non-structured sparsity; (3) regularize the DNN structure to improve classification accuracy. The results show that for CIFAR-10, regularization on layer depth reduces a 20-layer Deep Residual Network (ResNet) to 18 layers while improves the accuracy from 91.25% to 92.60%, which is still higher than that of original ResNet with 32 layers. For AlexNet, SSL reduces the error by â¼ 1%.},

An anisotropic and nonlinear regularization function is proposed to adequately punish the differences of the point spread functions (PSFs) in the process of optimization estimation. Some definitions of weighted second-order differences are given and a fast method to construct the matrix of second-order weighted gradient operator is derived. The PSF values can be quickly estimated. With the estimated PSFs, the true images can be recovered by non-blind restoration methods.

The Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Evolution Strategy (ES) will be a reference for the examination and validation of the DE and the SA. The main purpose is to minimize the weight of an assembly system composed of a shaft and two ball bearings. Ball bearings link system is used extensively in many machinery applications. Among mechanical systems, designers pay great attention to the ball bearings link system because of its significant industrial importance. The problem is complex and a time consuming process due to mixed design variables and inequality constraints imposed on the objective function. The results showed that the DE and the SA performed and obtained convergence reliability on the global optimum solution. So the contribution of the DE and the SA application to the mechanical system design can be very useful in many real-world mechanical system design problems. Beside, the comparison confirms the effectiveness and the superiority of the DE over the others algorithms â the SA, the GA, and the ES â in terms of solution quality.

Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse.

Starting from simple phase shifters to the most compact IQ modulators, we introduce key devices of high-speed data communications. For instance, all-plasmonic Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) are reviewed and long-term prospects are discussed. This kind of modulator already features unique properties such as a small footprint (<20 mu m(2)), a large electro-optic bandwidth (>110 GHz), a small energy consumption (similar to 25 fJ/b), a large extinction ratio (9 25 dB) in combination with a record small voltage-length product of 40 V mu m. Finally, as an example for seamless integration we introduce novel plasmonic IQ modulators. With such modulators we show the generation of advanced modulation formats (QPSK, 16-QAM) on footprints as small as 10 mu m x 75 mu m. This demonstration ultimately shows how plasmonics can be used to control both phase and amplitude of an optical carrier on the microscale with reasonably low losses.},

This theorem, however, relies on a number of strong assumptions and guarantees a polynomial factor on the size of the large network compared to the target function.

In this paper, we introduce bilevel evolutionary algorithm based on quadratic approximations (BLEAQ) of optimal lower level variables with respect to the upper level variables. The approach is capable of handling bilevel problems with different kinds of complexities in relatively smaller number of function evaluations. Ideas from classical optimization have been hybridized with evolutionary methods to generate an efficient optimization algorithm for a wide class of bilevel problems. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated on two sets of test problems. The first set is a recently proposed SMD test set, which contains problems with controllable complexities, and the second set contains standard test problems collected from the literature. The proposed method has been compared against three benchmarks, and the performance gain is observed to be significant.

abstract = {How to represent an image? While the visual world is presented in a continuous manner, machines store and see the images in a discrete way with 2D arrays of pixels. In this paper, we seek to learn a continuous representation for images. Inspired by the recent progress in 3D reconstruction with implicit function, we propose Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF), which takes an image coordinate and the 2D deep features around the coordinate as inputs, predicts the RGB value at a given coordinate as an output. Since the coordinates are continuous, LIIF can be presented in an arbitrary resolution. To generate the continuous representation for pixel-based images, we train an encoder and LIIF representation via a self-supervised task with super-resolution. The learned continuous representation can be presented in arbitrary resolution even extrapolate to $\times 30$ higher resolution, where the training tasks are not provided. We further show that LIIF representation builds a bridge between discrete and continuous representation in 2D, it naturally supports the learning tasks with size-varied image ground-truths and significantly outperforms the method with resizing the ground-truths.

The proposed algorithm uses fuzzy logic inference system to dynamically tune the mutation factor of DE and improve its exploration and exploitation. In this way, two factors, named, the number of generation and population diversity are considered as inputs and, one factor, named, the mutation factor as output of the fuzzy logic inference system. The performance of the suggested approach has been tested firstly by using some popular single objective test functions. It has been shown that the proposed method finds better solutions than the classical differential evolution and also the convergence rate of that is really fast. Secondly, a five degree of freedom vehicle vibration model is chosen to be optimally designed by the aforesaid proposed approach. Comparison of the obtained results with those in the literature demonstrates the superiority of the results of this work.},

@article{Hill2019,
abstract = {The question of whether deep neural networks are good at generalising beyond their immediate training experience is of critical importance for learning-based approaches to AI. Here, we consider tests of out-of-sample generalisation that require an agent to respond to never-seen-before instructions by manipulating and positioning objects in a 3D Unity simulated room. We first describe a comparatively generic agent architecture that exhibits strong performance on these tests. We then identify three aspects of the training regime and environment that make a significant difference to its performance: (a) the number of object/word experiences in the training set; (b) the visual invariances afforded by the agent's perspective, or frame of reference; and (c) the variety of visual input inherent in the perceptual aspect of the agent's perception. Our findings indicate that the degree of generalisation that networks exhibit can depend critically on particulars of the environment in which a given task is instantiated. They further suggest that the propensity for neural networks to generalise in systematic ways may increase if, like human children, those networks have access to many frames of richly varying, multi-modal observations as they learn.},

abstract = {The integration and adoption of digital technologies have enabled improvements in the quality of and inclusion in higher education. However, a significant proportion of the population has either remained or become digitally excluded. This systematic literature review elucidates the factors underlying the concepts of âdigital exclusionâ and the âdigital divideâ in higher education. The identified factors are grouped into three categories: social exclusion (i.e., low income, ICT-avoidance as the norm, lack of motivation and commitment, and physical or mental disability), digital exclusion (i.e., lack of hardware devices and Internet services) and accessibility (which include the division between rural and urban areas, as well as disparities in ICT literacy and information literacy). These factors are multi-tiered and overlapping. Studies on the digital divide, digital exclusion, and barriers to ICT adoption in higher education deal with similar factors, but these are experienced differently in different contexts. While generalizing these factors into categories enables a better understanding of the nature of digital exclusion, solving and circumventing them remains complex due their dependency on the particular context of a higher education institution.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017. With the increasing contribution of the power production by the photovoltaic (PV) systems to the electricity supply, the PV power forecasting becomes increasingly important. There are many factors influencing the forecasting performance, such as the air temperature, humidity, insolation, wind speed, wind direction and so on. This study proposes a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model-based PV power short-term forecasting approach. First, by means of the correlation analysis, the influential factors are selected as the model inputs. Then, the fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm and the recursive least squares method are used to identify the antecedent and the consequent parameters. The performance of the proposed forecasting approach is tested by using a large database of measurement data from the 433 kW PV array at St Lucia campus of The Queensland University of Australia. The forecasting results are compared with the support vector machine (SVM), the hybrid of empirical mode decomposition and SVM, the back propagation neural network and the recurrent neural network. The results indicate that, compared with the existing approaches, the proposed T-S fuzzy model-based forecasting approach is simpler and can forecast more accurately.},

@article{Ilievski2021,
abstract = {Commonsense knowledge is essential for many AI applications, including those in natural language processing, visual processing, and planning. Consequently, many sources that include commonsense knowledge have been designed and constructed over the past decades. Recently, the focus has been on large text-based sources, which facilitate easier integration with neural (language) models and application on textual tasks, typically at the expense of the semantics of the sources. Such practice prevents the harmonization of these sources, understanding their coverage and gaps, and may hinder the semantic alignment of their knowledge with downstream tasks. Efforts to consolidate commonsense knowledge have yielded partial success, but provide no clear path towards a comprehensive consolidation of existing commonsense knowledge. The ambition of this paper is to organize these sources around a common set of dimensions of commonsense knowledge. For this purpose, we survey a wide range of popular commonsense sources with a special focus on their relations. We consolidate these relations into 13 knowledge dimensions, each abstracting over more specific relations found in sources. This consolidation allows us to unify the separate sources and to compute indications of their coverage, overlap, and gaps with respect to the knowledge dimensions. Moreover, we analyze the impact of each dimension on downstream reasoning tasks that require commonsense knowledge, observing that the temporal and desire/goal dimensions are very beneficial for reasoning on current downstream tasks, while distinctness and lexical knowledge have little impact. These results reveal focus towards some dimensions in current evaluation, and potential neglect of others.},

abstract = {Ego-motion estimation and localization in large environments are key components in any assistive technology for real-time user orientation and navigation. We consider the case where a large known environment is explored without a priori assumptions on the initial location. In particular we propose a framework that uses a single portable 3D sensor to solve the place recognition problem and continuously tracks its position even when leaving the known area or when significant changes occur in the observed environment. We cast the place recognition step as a classification problem and propose an efficient search space reduction considering only navigable areas where the user can be localized. Classification hypotheses are then discarded exploiting temporal consistency w.r.t. a relative tracker that exploits only the sensor input data. The solution uses a compact classifier whose representation scales well with the map size. After being localized, the user is continuously tracked exploiting the known environment using an efficient data structure that provides constant access time for nearest neighbor searches and that can be streamed to keep only the local region close to the last known position in memory. Robust results are achieved by performing a geometrically stable selection of points, efficiently filtering outliers and integrating the relative tracker based on previous observations. We experimentally show that such a framework provides good localization results and that it scales well with the environment map size yielding real-time performance for both place recognition and tracking.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple unsupervised visual representation learning method with a pretext task of discriminating all images in a dataset using a parametric, instance-level classifier. The overall framework is a replica of a supervised classification model, where semantic classes (e.g., dog, bird, and ship) are replaced by instance IDs. However, scaling up the classification task from thousands of semantic labels to millions of instance labels brings specific challenges including 1) the large-scale softmax computation; 2) the slow convergence due to the infrequent visiting of instance samples; and 3) the massive number of negative classes that can be noisy. This work presents several novel techniques to handle these difficulties. First, we introduce a hybrid parallel training framework to make large-scale training feasible. Second, we present a raw-feature initialization mechanism for classification weights, which we assume offers a contrastive prior for instance discrimination and can clearly speed up converge in our experiments. Finally, we propose to smooth the labels of a few hardest classes to avoid optimizing over very similar negative pairs. While being conceptually simple, our framework achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, i.e., SimCLR, MoCoV2, and PIC under ImageNet linear evaluation protocol and on several downstream visual tasks, verifying that full instance classification is a strong pretraining technique for many semantic visual tasks.},

If, on the one side, the binocular coordination of camera movements is a complicating factor, on the other side, a proper vergence control, acting on the binocular disparity, facilitates the binocular fusion and the subsequent stereoscopic perception process. In real-world situations, an effective vergence control requires further features other than real time capabilities: real robot systems are indeed characterized by mechanical and geometrical imprecision that affect the binocular vision, and the illumination conditions are changeable and unpredictable. Moreover, in order to allow an effective visual exploration of the peripersonal space, it is necessary to cope with different gaze directions and provide a large working space. The proposed control strategy resorts to a neuromimetic approach that provides a distributed representation of disparity information. The vergence posture is obtained by an open-loop and a closed-loop control, which directly interacts with saccadic control. Before saccade, the open-loop component is computed in correspondence of the saccade target region, to obtain a vergence correction to be applied simultaneously with the saccade. At fixation, the closed-loop component drives the binocular disparity to zero in a foveal region. The obtained vergence servos are able to actively drive both the horizontal and the vertical alignment of the optical axes on the object of interest, thus ensuring a correct vergence posture. Experimental tests were purposely designed to measure the performance of the control in the peripersonal space, and were performed on three different robot platforms. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach yields real-time and effective vergence camera movements on a visual stimulus in a wide working range, regardless of the illumination in the environment and the geometry of the system.},

abstract = {In continual learning (CL), an agent learns from a stream of tasks leveraging prior experience to transfer knowledge to future tasks. It is an ideal framework to decrease the amount of supervision in the existing learning algorithms. But for a successful knowledge transfer, the learner needs to remember how to perform previous tasks. One way to endow the learner the ability to perform tasks seen in the past is to store a small memory, dubbed episodic memory, that stores few examples from previous tasks and then to replay these examples when training for future tasks. In this work, we empirically analyze the effectiveness of a very small episodic memory in a CL setup where each training example is only seen once. Surprisingly, across four rather different supervised learning benchmarks adapted to CL, a very simple baseline, that jointly trains on both examples from the current task as well as examples stored in the episodic memory, significantly outperforms specifically designed CL approaches with and without episodic memory. Interestingly, we find that repetitive training on even tiny memories of past tasks does not harm generalization, on the contrary, it improves it, with gains between 7% and 17% when the memory is populated with a single example per class.},

abstract = {Given a grayscale photograph as input, this paper attacks the problem of hallucinating a plausible color version of the photograph. This problem is clearly underconstrained, so previous approaches have either relied on significant user interaction or resulted in desaturated colorizations. We propose a fully automatic approach that produces vibrant and realistic colorizations. We embrace the underlying uncertainty of the problem by posing it as a classification task and use class-rebalancing at training time to increase the diversity of colors in the result. The system is implemented as a feed-forward pass in a CNN at test time and is trained on over a million color images. We evaluate our algorithm using a âcolorization Turing test,â asking human participants to choose between a generated and ground truth color image. Our method successfully fools humans on 32% of the trials, significantly higher than previous methods. Moreover, we show that colorization can be a powerful pretext task for self-supervised feature learning, acting as a cross-channel encoder. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance on several feature learning benchmarks.},

abstract = {The only well documented effect of light exposure on endocrine function is the suppression of nocturnal melatonin. Bright light exposure has behavioral effects, including the alleviation of sleepiness during nocturnal sleep deprivation. The present study examines the effects of bright light on the profiles of hormones known to be affected by sleep deprivation (TSH) or involved in behavioral activation (cortisol). Eight healthy men participated each in three studies involving 36 h of continuous wakefulness. In one study, the subjects were exposed to constant dim light (baseline). In the two other studies, dim light exposure was interrupted by a 3-h period of bright light exposure either from 0500-0800 h (early morning study) or from 1300-1600 h (afternoon study). Blood samples were obtained every 15 min for 24 h to determine melatonin, cortisol, and TSH concentrations. Alertness was estimated by the number of lapses on two computerized vigilance-sensitive performance tasks. The early morning transition from dim to bright light suppressed melatonin secretion, induced an immediate, greater than 50% elevation of cortisol levels, and limited the deterioration of alertness normally associated with overnight sleep deprivation. No effect was detected on TSH profiles. Afternoon exposure to bright light did not have any effect on either hormonal or behavioral parameters. The data unambiguously demonstrate an effect of light on the corticotropic axis that is dependent on time of day.},

abstract = {Current methods for training robust networks lead to a drop in test accuracy, which has led prior works to posit that a robustness-accuracy tradeoff may be inevitable in deep learning. We take a closer look at this phenomenon and first show that real image datasets are actually separated. With this property in mind, we then prove that robustness and accuracy should both be achievable for benchmark datasets through locally Lipschitz functions, and hence, there should be no inherent tradeoff between robustness and accuracy. Through extensive experiments with robustness methods, we argue that the gap between theory and practice arises from two limitations of current methods: either they fail to impose local Lipschitzness or they are insufficiently generalized. We explore combining dropout with robust training methods and obtain better generalization. We conclude that achieving robustness and accuracy in practice may require using methods that impose local Lipschitzness and augmenting them with deep learning generalization techniques.

Our goal is to simultaneously minimise the schedule's fuzzy makespan and maximise its robustness. To this end, we consider two measures of solution robustness: a predictive one, prior to the schedule execution, and an empirical one, measured at execution. To optimise both the expected makespan and the predictive robustness of the fuzzy schedule we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm combined with a novel dominance-based tabu search method. The resulting hybrid algorithm is then evaluated on existing benchmark instances, showing its good behaviour and the synergy between its components. The experimental results also serve to analyse the goodness of the predictive robustness measure, in terms of its correlation with simulations of the empirical measure.},

Superior results in pattern recognition can be directly provided in the forecasting, classification and data analysis. To bring proper results, ANN requires correct data pre-processing, architecture selection and network training but still the performance of a neural network depends on the size of network. Selection of hidden neurons in neural network is one of the major problems in the field of Artificial Neural Network. The random selections of hidden neurons may cause the problem of either Underfitting or Overfitting. Overfitting arises because the network matches the data so closely as to lose its generalization ability over the test data. The proposed method finds the near to optimal number of hidden nodes after training the ANN from real world data. The advantage of proposed method is that it is not approximately calculating number of hidden nodes but based on similarity between input data, they are calculated.},

In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of Memory-Constrained Online Continual Learning (MC-OCL) which imposes strict constraints on the memory overhead that a possible algorithm can use to avoid catastrophic forgetting. As most, if not all, previous CL methods violate these constraints, we propose an algorithmic solution to MC-OCL: Batch-level Distillation (BLD), a regularization-based CL approach, which effectively balances stability and plasticity in order to learn from data streams, while preserving the ability to solve old tasks through distillation. Our extensive experimental evaluation, conducted on three publicly available benchmarks, empirically demonstrates that our approach successfully addresses the MC-OCL problem and achieves comparable accuracy to prior distillation methods requiring higher memory overhead (Code available at https://github.com/DonkeyShot21/batch-level-distillation).},

TrAdaBoost allows users to utilize a small amount of newly labeled data to leverage the old data to construct a high-quality classification model for the new data. We show that this method can allow us to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data, even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone. We show that TrAdaBoost allows knowledge to be ef- fectively transferred from the old data to the new.

We directly elicit experimental subjects' beliefs about their relative performance on an IQ quiz and track the evolution of these beliefs in response to noisy feedback. Our main result is that subjects update as if they misinterpret the information content of signals, but then process these misinterpreted signals like Bayesians. Specifically, they are asymmetric, over-weighting positive feedback relative to negative, and conservative, updating too little in response to both positive and negative feedback. These biases are substantially less pronounced in a placebo experiment where ego is not at stake, suggesting they are motivated rather than cognitive. Consistent with Bayes' rule, on the other hand, updating is invariant to priors (and over time) and priors are sufficient statistics for past information. Based on these findings, we build a model that theoretically derives the optimal bias of a decision-maker with ego utility and show that it naturally gives rise to both asymmetry and conservatism as complementary strategies in self-confidence management.},

The fuzzy approach make possible to account for the vagueness and uncertainty of the pattern features. Even more, the use of fuzzy rules allows it to include that uncertainty into a trading decision system that not only advises the investor on when but also on how much capital to invest. In this way, the intelligent system helps the experts to use their knowledge, i.e. the candlestick-based rules, in a more natural and realistic way than the standard one based on crisp rules. In the paper we have illustrated this methodology with the generation of a fuzzy trading system that uses three well-known candlestick patterns that have been fuzzified. The performance of this intelligent stock trading system is tested in two portfolios of different stock markets, Nasdaq-100 and Eurostoxx, and it is compared against its crisp counterpart and the classical Buy-and-Hold trading strategy. Our fuzzy candlestick-based trading system not only improves the pattern recognition with respect to its crisp version, but it also provides promising results since it exhibits a more stable behavior in the markets analyzed, and obtains more profits in a less risky way than the other trading systems considered.},

However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold.

In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems.

Most of the people in the cities boil water to drink, and people of the villages take tube-well's water directly, which might have high amount of heavy metal like arsenic. Solar still is a cheap and very useful renewable technology, which can be used in Bangladesh extensively everywhere at the rooftop as a pure water source. Objective of this paper was to find a low cost portable and easily maintainable passive solar still for southern part of Bangladesh. All the parameters of passive solar still are studied, and it is found that an inclined stepped solar still with passive condenser, internal and external reflectors, black cotton wick, and with optimum design values can be the desired still, which would give maximum yield. Finally, the optimum values of the parameters are used to propose a cheap design.},

abstract = {Attaining prototypical features to represent class distributions is well established in representation learning. However, learning prototypes online from streams of data proves a challenging endeavor as they rapidly become outdated, caused by an ever-changing parameter space in the learning process. Additionally, continual learning does not assume the data stream to be stationary, typically resulting in catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. As a first, we introduce a system addressing both problems, where prototypes evolve continually in a shared latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point in time. In contrast to the major body of work in continual learning, data streams are processed in an online fashion, without additional task-information, and an efficient memory scheme provides robustness to imbalanced data streams. Besides nearest neighbor based prediction, learning is facilitated by a novel objective function, encouraging cluster density about the class prototype and increased inter-class variance. Furthermore, the latent space quality is elevated by pseudo-prototypes in each batch, constituted by replay of exemplars from memory. We generalize the existing paradigms in continual learning to incorporate data incremental learning from data streams by formalizing a two-agent learner-evaluator framework, and obtain state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin on eight benchmarks, including three highly imbalanced data streams.},

abstract = {Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in many cognitive tasks. However, when they are trained sequentially on multiple tasks without access to old data, their performance on early tasks tend to drop significantly. This problem is often referred to as catastrophic forgetting, a key challenge in continual learning of neural networks. The regularization-based approach is one of the primary classes of methods to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we provide a novel viewpoint of regularization-based continual learning by formulating it as a second-order Taylor approximation of the loss function of each task. This viewpoint leads to a unified framework that can be instantiated to derive many existing algorithms such as Elastic Weight Consolidation and Kronecker factored Laplace approximation. Based on this viewpoint, we study the optimization aspects (i.e., convergence) as well as generalization properties (i.e., finite-sample guarantees) of regularization-based continual learning. Our theoretical results indicate the importance of accurate approximation of the Hessian matrix. The experimental results on several benchmarks provide empirical validation of our theoretical findings.},

We challenge this hypothesis through an extensive empirical study for which we train 500 sampled CNN architectures on ImageNet as well as 8 other image classification datasets from a wide array of application domains. The relationship between architecture and performance varies wildly, depending on the datasets. For some of them, the performance correlation with ImageNet is even negative. Clearly, it is not enough to optimize architectures solely for ImageNet when aiming for progress that is relevant for all applications. Therefore, we identify two dataset-specific performance indicators: the cumulative width across layers as well as the total depth of the network. Lastly, we show that the range of dataset variability covered by ImageNet can be significantly extended by adding ImageNet subsets restricted to few classes.},

In this study, an effective model for daily water demand forecasting is proposed. Firstly, principle component analysis (PCA) is utilized to simplify the complexity and reduce the correlation between influence variables, and the score values of selected principle components (PCs) turn into the irrelevant input data of fuzzy neural network (FNN), which models the prediction of water demand. Moreover, an improved Levenberg-Marquardt (ILM) algorithm is employed to optimize the parameters of FNN simultaneously. Quassi-Hessian and gradient matrices could be calculated directly without the storage and multiplication of whole Jaccobian matrix, therefore the problems of heavy computing burden and limited memory space could be solved. At last, contrast experiments are implemented to demonstrate the fuzzy neural network with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (ILM-FNN) has better prediction performance and capability to handle practical issues.},

abstract = {There is an increasing need of continual learning in dynamic systems, such as the self-driving vehicle, the surveillance drone, and the robotic system. Such a system requires learning from the data stream, training the model to preserve previous information and adapt to a new task, and generating a single-headed vector for future inference. Different from previous approaches with dynamic structures, this work focuses on a single network and model segmentation to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Leveraging the redundant capacity of a single network, model parameters for each task are separated into two groups: one important group which is frozen to preserve current knowledge, and secondary group to be saved (not pruned) for a future learning. A fixed-size memory containing a small amount of previously seen data is further adopted to assist the training. Without additional regularization, the simple yet effective approach of PST successfully incorporates multiple tasks and achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy in the single-head evaluation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Moreover, the segmented training significantly improves computation efficiency in continual learning.},

abstract = {Piezo-composites composed of a piezoelectric ceramic and a polymer are promising materials because of their excellent tailorable properties. The geometry for two-phase composites can be classified according to the connectivity of each phase (1, 2 or 3 dimensionally) into 10 structures; 0-0, 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 2-2, 2-3 and 3-3. In particular, a 1-3 piezo-composite, or PZT-rod/polymer-matrix composite is considered most useful. The advantages of this composite are high coupling factors, low acoustic impedance, good matching to water or human tissue, mechanical flexibility, broad bandwidth in combination with a low mechanical quality factor and the possibility of making undiced arrays by simply patterning the electrodes. The acoustic match to tissue or water of the typical piezoceramics is significantly improved when it is incorporated into such a composite structure, that is, by replacing some of the dense and stiff ceramic with a less dense, more pliant polymer. Piezoelectric composite materials are especially useful for underwater sonar and medical diagnostic ultrasonic transducer applications. Other types of composites based on piezoelectric ceramics are also introduced in this chapter. Piezo-passive-dampers comprise a piezoelectric ceramic particle, polymer, and a carbon black, which suppress the noise vibration more effectively than traditional rubbers. A composite with a magnetostrictive ceramic and a piezoelectric ceramic produces an intriguing product effect, the magnetoelectric effect in which an electric field is produced in the material in response to an applied magnetic field. {\textcopyright} 2010 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Road sign recognition is a part of driver support systems. Its main aim is the increase of traffic safety by calling the driver's attention to the presence of key traffic signs. Additionally, a vision-based system able to detect and classify traffic signs from road images in real-time would also be useful as a support tool for guidance and navigation of intelligent vehicles. This paper proposes a new method for the detection and recognition of traffic signs using self-organising maps (SOM). This method first detects potential road signs by analysing the distribution of red pixels within the image, and then identifies these road signs from the distribution of dark pixels in their pictograms. Additionally, a novel hybrid system combining programmable hardware and artificial neural networks for embedded machine vision is introduced, and a prototype of this system is used in the implementation of the application. The experiments indicate a good performance of the new approach using SOM in both speed and classification accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A user-friendly multi-variable tuning problem is formulated based on user-specified time domain specifications and then simplified based on the structure of the closed-loop system. Based on the simplified tuning problem and a proposed performance evaluation technique, a fast multi-variable tuning technique is developed by ignoring the constraints of the MPC. In addition, a technique to predict the computation time of the tuning algorithm is proposed. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through Honeywell real time simulator platform with a MIMO paper-making process obtained from real data from an industrial site.},

abstract = {Existing object detection methods typically rely on the availability of abundant labelled training samples per class and offline model training in a batch mode. These requirements substantially limit their scalability to open-ended accommodation of novel classes with limited labelled training data, both in terms of model accuracy and training efficiency during deployment. We present the first study aiming to go beyond these limitations by considering the Incremental Few-Shot Detection (iFSD) problem setting, where new classes must be registered incrementally (without revisiting base classes) and with few examples. To this end we propose OpeN-ended Centre nEt (ONCE), a detector designed for incrementally learning to detect novel class objects with few examples. This is achieved by an elegant adaptation of the efficient CentreNet detector to the few-shot learning scenario, and meta-learning a class-wise code generator model for registering novel classes. ONCE fully respects the incremental learning paradigm, with novel class registration requiring only a single forward pass of few-shot training samples, and no access to base classes-thus making it suitable for deployment on embedded devices, etc. Extensive experiments conducted on both the standard object detection (COCO, PASCAL VOC) and fashion landmark detection (DeepFashion2) tasks show the feasibility of iFSD for the first time, opening an interesting and very important line of research.},

abstract = {The only well documented effect of light exposure on endocrine function is the suppression of nocturnal melatonin. Bright light exposure has behavioral effects, including the alleviation of sleepiness during nocturnal sleep deprivation. The present study examines the effects of bright light on the profiles of hormones known to be affected by sleep deprivation (TSH) or involved in behavioral activation (cortisol). Eight healthy men participated each in three studies involving 36 h of continuous wakefulness. In one study, the subjects were exposed to constant dim light (baseline). In the two other studies, dim light exposure was interrupted by a 3-h period of bright light exposure either from 0500-0800 h (early morning study) or from 1300-1600 h (afternoon study). Blood samples were obtained every 15 min for 24 h to determine melatonin, cortisol, and TSH concentrations. Alertness was estimated by the number of lapses on two computerized vigilance-sensitive performance tasks. The early morning transition from dim to bright light suppressed melatonin secretion, induced an immediate, greater than 50% elevation of cortisol levels, and limited the deterioration of alertness normally associated with overnight sleep deprivation. No effect was detected on TSH profiles. Afternoon exposure to bright light did not have any effect on either hormonal or behavioral parameters. The data unambiguously demonstrate an effect of light on the corticotropic axis that is dependent on time of day.},

This leads us to research ways to effectively adapt features and utilize the meta-learner's full potential. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of hypernetworks in this context. We propose a soft weight-sharing hypernetwork architecture and show that training the hypernetwork with a variant of MAML is tightly linked to meta-learning a curvature matrix used to condition gradients during fast adaptation. We achieve similar results as state-of-art model-agnostic methods in the overparametrized case, while outperforming many MAML variants without using different optimization schemes in the compressive regime. Furthermore, we empirically show that hypernetworks do leverage the inner loop optimization for better adaptation, and analyse how they naturally try to learn the shared curvature of constructed tasks on a toy problem when using our proposed training algorithm.},

With this system, the parking agency is able to decide the spatial and temporal distribution of parking prices to achieve a variety of objectives, while drivers with different origins and destinations compete for limited parking spaces via online reservation. We develop a multi-period non-cooperative bi-level model to capture the complex interactions among the parking agency and multiple drivers, as well as a non-myopic approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach to solve the model. It is shown with numerical examples that the ADP-based pricing policy consistently outperforms alternative policies in achieving greater performance of the parking system, and shows reliability in handling the spatial and temporal variations in parking demand.},

Neurons only update their states when receiving signals from other neurons. Total computation of the network thus scales with the number of spikes caused by an input rather than network size. We show that the spiking Multi-Layer Perceptron behaves identically, during both prediction and training, to a conventional deep network of rectified-linear units, in the limiting case where we run the spiking network for a long time. We apply this architecture to a conventional classification problem (MNIST) and achieve performance very close to that of a conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron with the same architecture. Our network is a natural architecture for learning based on streaming event-based data, and is a stepping stone towards using spiking neural networks to learn efficiently on streaming data.},

The first part of the study deals with prediction and estimation of upstream and down-stream station sediment data, separately, and the second part focuses on the estimation of downstream suspended sediment data by using data from both stations. In each case, the MLP test results are compared to those of generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), radial basis function (RBF) and multi-linear regression (MLR) for the best-input combinations.

abstract = {Knowledge distillation, in which a student model is trained to mimic a teacher model, has been proved as an effective technique for model compression and model accuracy boosting. However, most knowledge distillation methods, de- signed for image classification, have failed on more challenging tasks, such as ob- ject detection. In this paper, we suggest that the failure of knowledge distillation on object detection is mainly caused by two reasons: (1) the imbalance between pixels of foreground and background and (2) lack of distillation on the relation be- tween different pixels. Observing the above reasons, we propose attention-guided distillation and non-local distillation to address the two problems, respectively. Attention-guided distillation is proposed to find the crucial pixels of foreground objects with attention mechanism and then make the students take more effort to learn their features. Non-local distillation is proposed to enable students to learn not only the feature of an individual pixel but also the relation between dif- ferent pixels captured by non-local modules. Experiments show that our meth- ods achieve excellent AP improvements on both one-stage and two-stage, both anchor-based and anchor-free detectors. For example, Faster RCNN (ResNet101 backbone) with our distillation achieves 43.9 AP on COCO2017, which is 4.1 higher than the baseline. Codes are will be released on Github},

According to the reason shown in part I, this phase diagram can be divided into three regiors; paraelectric, ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases. The crystal structure of this system was determined by the Debye photographs. In the antiferroelectric region solid solutions have a tetragonal modification of perovskite structure with c / a <1 and have some superstructure which seems to have intimate relation to the antiferroelectricity. In the ferroelectric region, except a region near antiferroelectric phase in which pseudocubic structure is observed, they have ordinary tetragonal structure of c / a >1 without any superstructure.},

abstract = {Social power is a pervasive feature with acknowledged impact in a multitude of social processes. However, despite its importance, common approaches to social power interactions in multi-agent systems are rather simplistic and lack a full comprehensive view of the processes involved. In this work, we integrated a comprehensive model of social power dynamics into a cognitive agent architecture based on an operationalization of different bases of social power inspired by theoretical background research in social psychology. The model was implemented in an agent framework that was subsequently used to generate the behavior of virtual characters in an interactive virtual environment. We performed a user study to assess users' perceptions of the agents and found evidence supporting both the social power capabilities provided by the model and their value for the creation of believable and interesting scenarios. We expect that these advances and the collected evidence can be used to support the development of agent systems with an enriched capacity for social agent simulation.},

It also examines whether fuzzy decision making can simplify nutrition education by small individual improvements in food selection behaviour. RESULTS: The recommendations for nutrient intakes are presented as fuzzy sets, so that the intake of each nutrient can be evaluated by an objective fuzzy value. The evaluation of the harmonic minimum allows, for the first time, that the fuzzy value of an individual nutrient can be stated as a total value. On the basis of individual nutrition assessment, fuzzy logic in connection with fuzzy decision making, allows optimization of meals considering individual food preferences. This makes it possible in nutrition counselling to improve the nutrient intake markedly with relative small changes in food choice. CONCLUSION: Fuzzy decision making can simplify and optimize nutrition education.},

Thus, analyzing the electricity consumption's pattern becomes an important issue in order to reduce the total electricity consumption. This paper aims to analyze the electricity consumption in Taipei Bus Station located in Taipei City, Taiwan. This building is one of the busiest bus station in Taiwan. The analysis of the electricity consumption in this building is conducted based on the historical data of total electricity consumed by some cooling equipment installed in the building and the total electricity consumptions. In addition, the building temperatures, humidity and CO2 are also considered. In order to obtain an accurate forecasting, some data preprocessing approaches are conducted. They include the missing value prediction, data normalization, feature selection and discretization. Furthermore, a fuzzy neural network is applied to obtain the forecasting model. The experiments results show that the proposed research framework can obtain an accurate forecasting model with very small error. The result also reveals that the total electricity consumption is only highly related to some of the features studied in this paper while other factors do not significantly influence the total electricity consumption.},

abstract = {Objective: Patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are difficult to diagnose and they represent a very heterogeneous group. Some require immediate treatment while others, with only minor disorders, may be sent home. Detecting ACS patients using a machine learning approach would be advantageous in many situations. Methods and materials: Artificial neural network (ANN) ensembles and logistic regression models were trained on data from 634 patients presenting an emergency department with chest pain. Only data immediately available at patient presentation were used, including electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The models were analyzed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, calibration assessments, inter- and intra-method variations. Effective odds ratios for the ANN ensembles were compared with the odds ratios obtained from the logistic model. Results: The ANN ensemble approach together with ECG data preprocessed using principal component analysis resulted in an area under the ROC curve of 80%. At the sensitivity of 95% the specificity was 41%, corresponding to a negative predictive value of 97%, given the ACS prevalence of 21%. Adding clinical data available at presentation did not improve the ANN ensemble performance. Using the area under the ROC curve and model calibration as measures of performance we found an advantage using the ANN ensemble models compared to the logistic regression models. Conclusion: Clinically, a prediction model of the present type, combined with the judgment of trained emergency department personnel, could be useful for the early discharge of chest pain patients in populations with a low prevalence of ACS. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we consider semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) that incrementally learns from partially labeled data. Observing that existing continual learning methods lack the ability to continually exploit the unlabeled data, we propose deep Online Replay with Discriminator Consistency (ORDisCo) to interdependently learn a classifier with a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN), which continually passes the learned data distribution to the classifier. In particular, ORDisCo replays data sampled from the conditional generator to the classifier in an online manner, exploiting unlabeled data in a time- and storage-efficient way. Further, to explicitly overcome the catastrophic forgetting of unlabeled data, we selectively stabilize parameters of the discriminator that are important for discriminating the pairs of old unlabeled data and their pseudo-labels predicted by the classifier. We extensively evaluate ORDisCo on various semi-supervised learning benchmark datasets for SSCL, and show that ORDisCo achieves significant performance improvement on SVHN, CIFAR10 and Tiny-ImageNet, compared to strong baselines.},

abstract = {We present an approach for lifelong/continual learning of convolutional neural networks (CNN) that does not suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting when moving from one task to the other. We show that the activation maps generated by the CNN trained on the old task can be calibrated using very few calibration parameters, to become relevant to the new task. Based on this, we calibrate the activation maps produced by each network layer using spatial and channel-wise calibration modules and train only these calibration parameters for each new task in order to perform lifelong learning. Our calibration modules introduce significantly less computation and parameters as compared to the approaches that dynamically expand the network. Our approach is immune to catastrophic forgetting since we store the task-adaptive calibration parameters, which contain all the task-specific knowledge and is exclusive to each task. Further, our approach does not require storing data samples from the old tasks, which is done by many replay based methods. We perform extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (SVHN, CIFAR, ImageNet, and MS-Celeb), all of which show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods (e.g., a 29% absolute increase in accuracy on CIFAR-100 with 10 classes at a time). On large-scale datasets, our approach yields 23.8% and 9.7% absolute increase in accuracy on ImageNet-100 and MS-Celeb-10K datasets, respectively, by employing very few (0.51% and 0.35% of model parameters) task-adaptive calibration parameters.},

abstract = {The goal of self-supervised learning from images is to construct image representations that are semantically meaningful via pretext tasks that do not require semantic annotations for a large training set of images. Many pretext tasks lead to representations that are covariant with image transformations. We argue that, instead, semantic representations ought to be invariant under such transformations. Specifically, we develop Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL, pronounced as âpearlâ) that learns invariant representations based on pretext tasks. We use PIRL with a commonly used pretext task that involves solving jigsaw puzzles. We find that PIRL substantially improves the semantic quality of the learned image representations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised learning from images on several popular benchmarks for self-supervised learning. Despite being unsupervised, PIRL outperforms supervised pre-training in learning image representations for object detection. Altogether, our results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning of image representations with good invariance properties.},

abstract = {While recent continual learning methods largely alleviate the catastrophic problem on toy-sized datasets, some issues remain to be tackled to apply them to real-world problem domains. First, a continual learning model should effectively handle catastrophic forgetting and be efficient to train even with a large number of tasks. Secondly, it needs to tackle the problem of order-sensitivity, where the performance of the tasks largely varies based on the order of the task arrival sequence, as it may cause serious problems where fairness plays a critical role (e.g. medical diagnosis). To tackle these practical challenges, we propose a novel continual learning method that is scalable as well as order-robust, which instead of learning a completely shared set of weights, represents the parameters for each task as a sum of task-shared and sparse task-adaptive parameters. With our Additive Parameter Decomposition (APD), the task-adaptive parameters for earlier tasks remain mostly unaffected, where we update them only to reflect the changes made to the task-shared parameters. This decomposition of parameters effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting and order-sensitivity, while being computation- and memory-efficient. Further, we can achieve even better scalability with APD using hierarchical knowledge consolidation, which clusters the task-adaptive parameters to obtain hierarchically shared parameters. We validate our network with APD, APD-Net, on multiple benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art continual learning methods, which it largely outperforms in accuracy, scalability, and order-robustness.},

abstract = {Do visual tasks have relationships, or are they unrelated? For instance, could having surface normals simplify estimating the depth of an image? Intuition answers these questions positively, implying existence of a certain structure among visual tasks. Understanding this structure has notable values: it provides a principled way for identifying relationships across tasks, for instance, in order to reuse supervision among redundant tasks or solve many tasks in one system without piling up the complexity. We propose a fully computational approach for identifying the transfer learning structure of the space of visual tasks. This is done via computing the transfer learning dependencies across tasks in a dictionary of twenty-six 2D, 2.5D, 3D, and semantic tasks. The product is a computational taxonomic map among tasks for transfer learning, and we exploit it to reduce the demand for labeled data. For example, we show that the total number of labeled datapoints needed for solving a set of 10 tasks can be reduced by roughly 32 (compared to training independently) while keeping the performance nearly the same. We provide a set of tools for computing and visualizing this taxonomical structure at http://taskonomy.vision.},

Achieving high performance on each new topology remains challenging, as each requires some level of manual effort. This issue is compounded by the proliferation of frameworks and hardware platforms. The current approach, which we call "direct optimization", requires deep changes within each framework to improve the training performance for each hardware backend (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs) and requires $\mathcal{O}(fp)$ effort; where $f$ is the number of frameworks and $p$ is the number of platforms. While optimized kernels for deep-learning primitives are provided via libraries like Intel Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (MKL-DNN), there are several compiler-inspired ways in which performance can be further optimized. Building on our experience creating neon (a fast deep learning library on GPUs), we developed Intel nGraph, a soon to be open-sourced C++ library to simplify the realization of optimized deep learning performance across frameworks and hardware platforms. Initially-supported frameworks include TensorFlow, MXNet, and Intel neon framework. Initial backends are Intel Architecture CPUs (CPU), the Intel(R) Nervana Neural Network Processor(R) (NNP), and NVIDIA GPUs. Currently supported compiler optimizations include efficient memory management and data layout abstraction. In this paper, we describe our overall architecture and its core components. In the future, we envision extending nGraph API support to a wider range of frameworks, hardware (including FPGAs and ASICs), and compiler optimizations (training versus inference optimizations, multi-node and multi-device scaling via efficient sub-graph partitioning, and HW-specific compounding of operations).},

abstract = {Continual learning aims to provide intelligent agents capable of learning multiple tasks sequentially with neural networks. One of its main challenging, catastrophic forgetting, is caused by the neural networks non-optimal ability to learn in non-stationary distributions. In most settings of the current approaches, the agent starts from randomly initialized parameters and is optimized to master the current task regardless of the usefulness of the learned representation for future tasks. Moreover, each of the future tasks uses all the previously learned knowledge although parts of this knowledge might not be helpful for its learning. These cause interference among tasks, especially when the data of previous tasks is not accessible. In this paper, we propose a new method, named Self-Attention Meta-Learner (SAM), which learns a prior knowledge for continual learning that permits learning a sequence of tasks, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. SAM incorporates an attention mechanism that learns to select the particular relevant representation for each future task. Each task builds a specific representation branch on top of the selected knowledge, avoiding the interference between tasks. We evaluate the proposed method on the Split CIFAR-10/100 and Split MNIST benchmarks in the task agnostic inference. We empirically show that we can achieve a better performance than several state-of-the-art methods for continual learning by building on the top of selected representation learned by SAM. We also show the role of the meta-attention mechanism in boosting informative features corresponding to the input data and identifying the correct target in the task agnostic inference. Finally, we demonstrate that popular existing continual learning methods gain a performance boost when they adopt SAM as a starting point.},

abstract = {We propose a method to train a model so it can learn new classification tasks while improving with each task solved. This amounts to combining meta-learning with incremental learning. Different tasks can have disjoint classes, so one cannot directly align different classifiers as done in model distillation. On the other hand, simply aligning features shared by all classes does not allow the base model sufficient flexibility to evolve to solve new tasks. We therefore indirectly align features relative to a minimal set of "anchor classes." Such indirect discriminant alignment (IDA) adapts a new model to old classes without the need to reprocess old data, while leaving maximum flexibility for the model to adapt to new tasks. This process enables incrementally improving the model by processing multiple learning episodes, each representing a different learning task, even with few training examples. Experiments on few-shot learning benchmarks show that this incremental approach performs favorably even compared to training the model with the entire dataset at once.},

abstract = {The third law of thermodynamics has a controversial past and a number of formulations due to Planck, Einstein, and Nernst. It's most accepted version, the unattainability principle, states that "any thermodynamic process cannot reach the temperature of absolute zero by a finite number of steps and within a finite time." Although formulated in 1912, there has been no general proof of the principle, and the only evidence we have for it is that particular cooling methods become less efficient as the temperature decreases. Here we provide the first derivation of a general unattainability principle, which applies to arbitrary cooling processes, even those exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics or involving an infinite-dimensional reservoir. We quantify the resources needed to cool a system to any particular temperature, and translate these resources into a minimal time or number of steps by considering the notion of a Thermal Machine which obeys similar restrictions to universal computers. We generally find that the obtainable temperature can scale as an inverse power of the cooling time. Our argument relies on the heat capacity of the bath being positive, and we show that if this is not the case then perfect cooling in finite time is in principle possible. Our results also clarify the connection between two versions of the third law (the Unattainability Principle and the Heat Theorem), and place ultimate bounds on the speed at which information can be erased.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the performance of neural networks for perimetric glaucoma diagnosis when using different types of data inputs: numerical threshold sensitivities, Statpac Total Deviation and Pattern Deviation, and probability scores based on Total and Pattern Deviation probability maps (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). METHODS: The results of SITA Standard visual field tests in 213 healthy subjects, 127 patients with glaucoma, 68 patients with concomitant glaucoma and cataract, and 41 patients with cataract only were included. The five different types of input data were entered into five identically designed artificial neural networks. Network thresholds were adjusted for each network. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to display the combinations of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Input data in the form of Pattern Deviation probability scores gave the best results, with an area of 0.988 under the ROC curve, and were significantly better (P < 0.001) than threshold sensitivities and numerical Total Deviations and Total Deviation probability scores. The second best result was obtained with numerical Pattern Deviations with an area of 0.980. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of type of data input had important effects on the performance of the neural networks in glaucoma diagnosis. Refined input data, based on Pattern Deviations, resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity than did raw threshold values. Neural networks may have high potential in the production of useful clinical tools for the classification of visual field tests.},

We propose structural model distillation for memory reduction using a strategy that produces a student architecture that is a simple transformation of the teacher architecture: no redesign is needed, and the same hyperparameters can be used. Using attention transfer, we provide Pareto curves/tables for distillation of residual networks with four benchmark datasets, indicating the memory versus accuracy payoff. We show that substantial memory savings are possible with very little loss of accuracy, and confirm that distillation provides student network performance that is better than training that student architecture directly on data.},

Despite recent remarkable progress in state-of-the-art deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) are still plagued with the catastrophic forgetting problem. This paper presents a conceptually simple yet general and effective framework for handling catastrophic forgetting in continual learning with DNNs. The proposed method consists of two components: a neural structure optimization component and a parameter learning and/or fine-tuning component. By separating the explicit neural structure learning and the parameter estimation, not only is the proposed method capable of evolving neural structures in an intuitively meaningful way, but also shows strong capabilities of alleviating catastrophic forgetting in experiments. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms all other baselines on the permuted MNIST dataset, the split CIFAR100 dataset and the Visual Domain Decathlon dataset in continual learning setting},

abstract = {A dataset is a shred of crucial evidence to describe a task. However, each data point in the dataset does not have the same potential, as some of the data points can be more representative or informative than others. This unequal importance among the data points may have a large impact in rehearsal-based continual learning, where we store a subset of the training examples (coreset) to be replayed later to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. In continual learning, the quality of the samples stored in the coreset directly affects the model's effectiveness and efficiency. The coreset selection problem becomes even more important under realistic settings, such as imbalanced continual learning or noisy data scenarios. To tackle this problem, we propose Online Coreset Selection (OCS), a simple yet effective method that selects the most representative and informative coreset at each iteration and trains them in an online manner. Our proposed method maximizes the model's adaptation to a target dataset while selecting high-affinity samples to past tasks, which directly inhibits catastrophic forgetting. We validate the effectiveness of our coreset selection mechanism over various standard, imbalanced, and noisy datasets against strong continual learning baselines, demonstrating that it improves task adaptation and prevents catastrophic forgetting in a sample-efficient manner.},

We consider the problem of multi-domain few-shot image classification, where unseen classes and examples come from diverse data sources. This problem has seen growing interest and has inspired the development of benchmarks such as Meta-Dataset. A key challenge in this multi-domain setting is to effectively integrate the feature representations from the diverse set of training domains. Here, we propose a Universal Representation Transformer (URT) layer, that meta-learns to leverage universal features for few-shot classification by dynamically re-weighting and composing the most appropriate domain-specific representations. In experiments, we show that URT sets a new state-of-the-art result on Meta-Dataset. Specifically, it outperforms the best previous model on three data sources or performs the same in others. We analyze variants of URT and present a visualization of the attention score heatmaps that sheds light on how the model performs cross-domain generalization.

We analyze the key properties of eight popular incremental methods representing different algorithm classes. Thereby, we evaluate them with regards to their on-line classification error as well as to their behavior in the limit. Further, we discuss the often neglected issue of hyperparameter optimization specifically for each method and test how robustly it can be done based on a small set of examples. Our extensive evaluation on data sets with different characteristics gives an overview of the performance with respect to accuracy, convergence speed as well as model complexity, facilitating the choice of the best method for a given application.},

abstract = {Ultrasound molecular imaging using targeting microbubbles is predominantly a semi-quantitative tool, thus limiting its potential diagnostic power and clinical applications. In the work described here, we developed a novel method for acoustic quantification of molecular expression. E-Selectin expression in the mouse heart was induced by lipopolysaccharide. Real-time ultrasound imaging of E-selectin expression in the heart was performed using E-selectin-targeting microbubbles and a clinical ultrasound scanner in contrast pulse sequencing mode at 14 MHz, with a mechanical index of 0.22-0.26. The level of E-selectin expression was quantified using a novel time-signal intensity curve analytical method based on bubble elimination, which consisted of curve-fitting the bi-exponential equation Itissue(t)=Afe-$\lambda$ft+Are-$\lambda$rtto the elimination phase of the myocardial time-signal intensity curve. Arand Afrepresent the maximum signal intensities of the retained and freely circulating bubbles in the myocardium, respectively; $\lambda$rand $\lambda$frepresent the elimination rate constants of the retained and freely circulating bubbles in the myocardium, respectively. Arcorrelated strongly with the level of E-selectin expression (|r|>0.8), determined using reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the duration of post-lipopolysaccharide treatment-both linearly related to cell surface E-selectin protein (actual bubble target) concentration in the expression range imaged. Compared with a conventional acoustic quantification method (which used retained bubble signal intensity at 20 min post-bubble injection), this new approach exhibited greater dynamic range and sensitivity and was able to simultaneously quantify other useful characteristics (e.g., the microbubble half-life). In conclusion, quantitative determination of the level of molecular expression is feasible acoustically using a time-signal intensity curve analytical method based on bubble elimination.},

abstract = {Transformers, which are popular for language modeling, have been explored for solving vision tasks recently, e.g., the Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification. The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance compared with CNNs when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset (e.g., ImageNet). We find it is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the important local structure (e.g., edges, lines) among neighboring pixels, leading to its low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone design of ViT leads to limited feature richness in fixed computation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformers (T2T-ViT), which introduces 1) a layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure presented by surrounding tokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformers motivated by CNN architecture design after extensive study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the parameter counts and MACs of vanilla ViT by 200\%, while achieving more than 2.5\% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms ResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets when directly training on ImageNet. For example, T2T-ViT with ResNet50 comparable size can achieve 80.7\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. (Code: https://github.com/yitu-opensource/T2T-ViT)},

Existing outcome prediction models suffer from a low recall of infrequent positive outcomes. We present a highly-scalable and robust machine learning framework to automatically predict adversity represented by mortality and ICU admission from time-series vital signs and laboratory results obtained within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. The stacked platform comprises two components: a) an unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder that learns an optimal representation of the time-series, using it to differentiate the less frequent patterns which conclude with an adverse event from the majority patterns that do not, and b) a gradient boosting model, which relies on the constructed representation to refine prediction, incorporating static features of demographics, admission details and clinical summaries. The model is used to assess a patient's risk of adversity over time and provides visual justifications of its prediction based on the patient's static features and dynamic signals. Results of three case studies for predicting mortality and ICU admission show that the model outperforms all existing outcome prediction models, achieving PR-AUC of 0.93 (95$%$ CI: 0.878 - 0.969) in predicting mortality in ICU and general ward settings and 0.987 (95$%$ CI: 0.985-0.995) in predicting ICU admission.},

abstract = {Multi-horizon forecasting problems often contain a complex mix of inputs - including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed historically - without any prior information on how they interact with the target. While several deep learning models have been proposed for multi-step prediction, they typically comprise black-box models which do not account for the full range of inputs present in common scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) - a novel attention-based architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, the TFT utilizes recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for learning long-term dependencies. The TFT also uses specialized components for the judicious selection of relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of regimes. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase three practical interpretability use-cases of TFT.},

abstract = {Lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that a dense neural network contains a sparse sub-network that can match the test accuracy of the original dense net when trained in isolation from (the same) random initialization. However, the hypothesis failed to generalize to larger dense networks such as ResNet-50. As a remedy, recent studies demonstrate that a sparse sub-network can still be obtained by using a rewinding technique, which is to re-train it from early-phase training weights or learning rates of the dense model, rather than from random initialization. Is rewinding the only or the best way to scale up lottery tickets? This paper proposes a new, simpler and yet powerful technique for re-training the sub-network, called "Knowledge Distillation ticket" (KD ticket). Rewinding exploits the value of inheriting knowledge from the early training phase to improve lottery tickets in large networks. In comparison, KD ticket addresses a complementary possibility - inheriting useful knowledge from the late training phase of the dense model. It is achieved by leveraging the soft labels generated by the trained dense model to re-train the sub-network, instead of the hard labels. Extensive experiments are conducted using several large deep networks (e.g ResNet-50 and ResNet-110) on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Without bells and whistles, when applied by itself, KD ticket performs on par or better than rewinding, while being nearly free of hyperparameters or ad-hoc selection. KD ticket can be further applied together with rewinding, yielding state-of-the-art results for large-scale lottery tickets.},

Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

abstract = {Contrastive learning is very effective at learning useful representations without supervision. Yet contrastive learning has its limitations. It can learn a shortcut that is irrelevant to the downstream task, and discard relevant information. Past work has addressed this limitation via custom data augmentations that eliminate the shortcut. This solution however does not work for data modalities that are not interpretable by humans, e.g., radio signals. For such modalities, it is hard for a human to guess which shortcuts may exist in the signal, or how to alter the radio signals to eliminate the shortcuts. Even for visual data, sometimes eliminating the shortcut may be undesirable. The shortcut may be irrelevant to one downstream task but important to another. In this case, it is desirable to learn a representation that captures both the shortcut information and the information relevant to the other downstream task. This paper presents information-preserving contrastive learning (IPCL), a new framework for unsupervised representation learning that preserves relevant information even in the presence of shortcuts. We empirically show that IPCL addresses the above problems and outperforms contrastive learning on radio signals and learning RGB data representation with different features that support different downstream tasks.},

abstract = {Approaches to continual learning aim to successfully learn a set of related tasks that arrive in an online manner. Recently, several frameworks have been developed which enable deep learning to be deployed in this learning scenario. A key mod- elling decision is to what extent the architecture should be shared across tasks. On the one hand, separately modelling each task avoids catastrophic forgetting but it does not support transfer learning and leads to large models. On the other hand, rigidly specifying a shared component and a task-specific part enables task transfer and limits the model size, but it is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting and restricts the form of task-transfer that can occur. Ideally, the network should adaptively identify which parts of the network to share in a data driven way. Here we intro- duce such an approach called Continual Learning with Adaptive Weights (CLAW), which is based on probabilistic modelling and variational inference. Experiments show that CLAW achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks in terms of overall continual learning performance, as measured by classification accuracy, and in terms of addressing catastrophic forgetting.},

abstract = {1.1 Lidar and the Atmosphere Atmospheric research nowadays is hard to conceive without the use of remote-sensing techniques. Light detection and ranging (lidar) is, along with radiowave detection and ranging (radar), one of the backbones of the research field that deals with the profiling of the atmosphere. High spatial and temporal resolution of the measurements, the possibility of observing the atmosphere at ambient conditions, and the potential of covering the height range from the ground to more than 100 km altitude make up the attractiveness of lidar instruments. The variety of interaction processes of the emitted radiation with the atmospheric constituents that can be used in lidar allow the determination of the basic atmospheric variables of state, i.e., temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind, as well as the measurement of trace gases, aerosols, and clouds. Lidar has largely contributed to our knowledge of the Earth's atmosphere during the past decades. It is particularly useful for the investigation of highly variable atmospheric parameters. Lidar has the potential for the observation of processes on scales that extend from a few cubic meters and a few seconds to global, multi-year coverage. Lidar has been used to investigate turbulent processes and the diur-nal cycle of the planetary boundary layer, including the measurement of water-vapor and ozone fluxes. Meteorological phenomena such as frontal passages, hurricanes, and mountain lee waves were studied. Lidar helps monitor emission rates and concentration levels of trace gases. The stratospheric ozone depletion is documented globally with lidar. The role of polar stratospheric clouds is investigated and the classification of 2 Ulla Wandinger polar stratospheric clouds is based on their scattering properties as seen with lidar. Lidar is used to distinguish water droplets from ice crystals in clouds. Lidar contributes to our knowledge of the climatic effects of aerosols. The stratospheric perturbation after major volcanic eruptions has been studied and the intercontinental transport of air pollution, desert dust, and forest-fire smoke has been detected. In the mesosphere, lidar has proven the existence of layers of metallic atoms and ions and of gravity waves therein. Lidar instruments can operate from the ground or from aircraft, one system has been flown on the Space Shuttle, and in the near future satellite-based lidar instruments will carry out global observations of atmospheric constituents from space. These and many more aspects of lidar are presented in this book giving an overview on the state of the art of the basic lidar techniques used in the investigation of the Earth's atmosphere.},

We also provide an action recognition pipeline, and propose a number of specialised depth-aware techniques including five interest point detectors and three feature descriptors. Extensive tests allow evaluation of different appearance and depth encoding schemes. Our novel techniques exploiting this depth allow us to reach performance levels more than triple those of the best baseline algorithm using only appearance information.

First, we analyze a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on scene classification and discover units that match a diverse set of object concepts. We find evidence that the network has learned many object classes that play crucial roles in classifying scene classes. Second, we use a similar analytic method to analyze a generative adversarial network (GAN) model trained to generate scenes. By analyzing changes made when small sets of units are activated or deactivated, we find that objects can be added and removed from the output scenes while adapting to the context. Finally, we apply our analytic framework to understanding adversarial attacks and to semantic image editing.},

abstract = {Humans can incrementally learn to do new visual detection tasks, which is a huge challenge for today's computer vision systems. Incrementally trained deep learning models lack backwards transfer to previously seen classes and suffer from a phenomenon known as âcatastrophic forgetting.â In this paper, we pioneer online streaming learning for object detection, where an agent must learn examples one at a time with severe memory and computational constraints. In object detection, a system must output all bounding boxes for an image with the correct label. Unlike earlier work, the system described in this paper can learn this task in an online manner with new classes being introduced over time. We achieve this capability by using a novel memory replay mechanism that efficiently replays entire scenes. We achieve state-of-the-art results on both the PASCAL VOC 2007 and MS COCO datasets.},

abstract = {Rehearsal is a critical component for class-incremental continual learning, yet it requires a substantial memory budget. Our work investigates whether we can significantly reduce this memory budget by leveraging unlabeled data from an agent's environment in a realistic and challenging continual learning paradigm. Specifically, we explore and formalize a novel semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) setting, where labeled data is scarce yet non-i.i.d. unlabeled data from the agent's environment is plentiful. Importantly, data distributions in the SSCL setting are realistic and therefore reflect object class correlations between, and among, the labeled and unlabeled data distributions. We show that a strategy built on pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection, and knowledge distillation reduces forgetting in this setting. Our approach, DistillMatch, increases performance over the state-of-the-art by no less than 8.7% average task accuracy and up to a 54.5% increase in average task accuracy in SSCL CIFAR-100 experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate that DistillMatch can save up to 0.23 stored images per processed unlabeled image compared to the next best method which only saves 0.08. Our results suggest that focusing on realistic correlated distributions is a significantly new perspective, which accentuates the importance of leveraging the world's structure as a continual learning strategy.},

This silly sentence makes a serious point: As humans, we can flexibly generate and comprehend an unbounded number of complex ideas. Little is known, however, about how our brains accomplish this. Here we assemble clues from disparate areas of cognitive neuroscience, integrating recent research on language, memory, episodic simulation, and computational models of high-level cognition. Our review is framed by Fodor's classic language of thought hypothesis, according to which our minds employ an amodal, language-like system for combining and recombining simple concepts to form more complex thoughts. Here, we highlight emerging work on combinatorial processes in the brain and consider this work's relation to the language of thought. We review evidence for distinct, but complementary, contributions of map-like representations in subregions of the default mode network and sentence-like representations of conceptual relations in regions of the temporal and prefrontal cortex.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 71 is January 4, 2020.

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map raw pixels from a single front-facing camera directly to steering commands. This end-to-end approach proved surprisingly powerful. With minimum training data from humans the system learns to drive in traffic on local roads with or without lane markings and on highways. It also operates in areas with unclear visual guidance such as in parking lots and on unpaved roads. The system automatically learns internal representations of the necessary processing steps such as detecting useful road features with only the human steering angle as the training signal. We never explicitly trained it to detect, for example, the outline of roads. Compared to explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane marking detection, path planning, and control, our end-to-end system optimizes all processing steps simultaneously. We argue that this will eventually lead to better performance and smaller systems. Better performance will result because the internal components self-optimize to maximize overall system performance, instead of optimizing human-selected intermediate criteria, e.g., lane detection. Such criteria understandably are selected for ease of human interpretation which doesn't automatically guarantee maximum system performance. Smaller networks are possible because the system learns to solve the problem with the minimal number of processing steps. We used an NVIDIA DevBox and Torch 7 for training and an NVIDIA DRIVE(TM) PX self-driving car computer also running Torch 7 for determining where to drive. The system operates at 30 frames per second (FPS).},

Marine bacteria and their efficiency in crude oil recovery has been less studied than terrestrial strain, hence this present study. A novel marine bacterium Bacillus simplex having promising biosurfactant production was isolated from a petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated coastal sea sediment samples of Nagapattinam fishing harbor, Tamil Nadu, India. This strain showed most economical biosurfactant production with an agro-industrial waste substrate, sunflower oil cake at 54th h time incubation along with the cultural conditions of 20ppt salinity, 35Â°C temperature, and pH7. The produced biosurfactant was purified, which was accounted at 908Â±7mg/L on dry weight basis. The biosurfactant was identified as lipopeptide with a molecular mass of 1111.1Da which was deduced using TLC, biochemical estimation methods, FT-IR, NMR, and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Furthermore, this purified lipopeptide surfactant showed consistent and enhanced crude oil recovering efficiency under different salinity conditions (0â30%). Based on the above facts, the isolated novel marine bacterium proved its cheaper production of novel biosurfactant and its promising oil recovering efficiency even at hypersaline conditions. Further, this is the first report of a biosurfactant from the bacterium Bacillus simplex.},

We derive the first generalisation guarantees for the algorithm OGD for continual learning, for overparameterized neural networks. We find that OGD is only provably robust to catastrophic forgetting across a single task. We propose OGD+, prove that it is robust to catastrophic forgetting across an arbitrary number of tasks, and that it verifies tighter generalisation bounds. Our experiments show that OGD+ achieves state-of-the-art results on settings with a large number of tasks, even though the models are not overparameterized. Also, we derive a closed form expression of the learned models through tasks, as a recursive kernel regression relation, which captures the transferability of knowledge through tasks. Finally, we quantify theoretically the impact of task ordering on the generalisation error, which highlights the importance of the curriculum for lifelong learning.},

abstract = {We present a framework for training GANs with explicit control over generated images. We are able to control the generated image by settings exact attributes such as age, pose, expression, etc. Most approaches for editing GAN-generated images achieve partial control by leveraging the latent space disentanglement properties, obtained implicitly after standard GAN training. Such methods are able to change the relative intensity of certain attributes, but not explicitly set their values. Recently proposed methods, designed for explicit control over human faces, harness morphable 3D face models to allow fine-grained control capabilities in GANs. Unlike these methods, our control is not constrained to morphable 3D face model parameters and is extendable beyond the domain of human faces. Using contrastive learning, we obtain GANs with an explicitly disentangled latent space. This disentanglement is utilized to train control-encoders mapping human-interpretable inputs to suitable latent vectors, thus allowing explicit control. In the domain of human faces we demonstrate control over identity, age, pose, expression, hair color and illumination. We also demonstrate control capabilities of our framework in the domains of painted portraits and dog image generation. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

There has been a few recent methods that attempt to address this problem by minimizing the discrepancy between individual object proposal responses for old classes from the original and the updated networks. Different from these methods, we introduce a novel approach that not only focuses on what knowledge to transfer but also how to effectively transfer for minimizing the effect of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning of object detectors. Towards this, we first propose a proposal selection mechanism using ground truth objects from the new classes and then a relation guided transfer loss function that aims to preserve the relations of selected proposals between the base network and the new network trained on additional classes. Experiments on three standard datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {The two fields of machine learning and graphical causality arose and developed separately. However, there is now cross-pollination and increasing interest in both fields to benefit from the advances of the other. In the present paper, we review fundamental concepts of causal inference and relate them to crucial open problems of machine learning, including transfer and generalization, thereby assaying how causality can contribute to modern machine learning research. This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.},

abstract = {In this study, three models of machine learning algorithms are implemented to predict wind speed, wind direction and output power of a wind turbine. The first model is multilayer feed-forward neural network (MLFFNN) that is trained with different data training algorithms. The second model is support vector regression with a radial basis function (SVR-RBF). The third model is adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that is optimized with a partial swarm optimization algorithm (ANFIS-PSO). Temperature, pressure, relative humidity and local time are considered as input variables of the models. A large set of wind speed and wind direction data measured at 5-min, 10-min, 30-min and 1-h intervals are utilized to accurately predict wind speed and its direction for Bushehr. Energy and exergy analysis of wind energy for a wind turbine (E-44, 900 kW) is done. Also, the developed models are used to predict the output power of the wind turbine. Comparison of the statistical indices for the predicted and actual data indicate that the SVR-RBF model outperforms the MLFFNN and ANFIS-PSO models. Also, the current energy and exergy analysis presents an average of 32% energy efficiency and approximately 25% exergy efficiency of the wind turbine in the study region.},

abstract = {The quality and quantity of observed and reanalysed data influence the direction and accuracy of scientific research. This paper reviews the data available for the study of climate and weather patterns in Australia. A list of global reanalysis and satellite data is provided, along with a more detailed review of available in situ (weather station) data in Australia. Regularly updated climate indices are identified that have previously been linked to Australian climate and weather events. Observation of Australian weather is severely hampered by the continents' vastness and remoteness, as evidenced by heavy bias of in situ measurements that are generally clustered in the coastal high-population centres (mainly southeast of Australia), with central and northern regions often having to rely on remote sensing and reanalysis data. Data sparsity can introduce significant uncertainty in terms of extreme weather and climate change management, as variables such as rainfall exhibit high spatial and temporal variability. Several areas for future research are identified, including investigation into the impact of Australian aerosol levels, the connection between soil moisture and flooding potential, and teleconnection between Atlantic sea surface temperature and Australian climate. While this study focusses on data availability to investigate Australian climate patterns, findings are applicable at a global scale.},

abstract = {In continual learning, the learner faces a stream of data whose distribution changes over time. Modern neural networks are known to suffer under this setting, as they quickly forget previously acquired knowledge. To address such catastrophic forgetting, many continual learning methods implement different types of experience replay, re-learning on past data stored in a small buffer known as episodic memory. In this work, we complement experience replay with a new objective that we call âanchoringâ, where the learner uses bilevel optimization to update its knowledge on the current task, while keeping intact the predictions on some anchor points of past tasks. These anchor points are learned using gradient-based optimization to maximize forgetting, which is approximated by fine-tuning the currently trained model on the episodic memory of past tasks. Experiments on several supervised learning benchmarks for continual learning demonstrate that our approach improves the standard experience replay in terms of both accuracy and forgetting metrics and for various sizes of episodic memories.},

abstract = {Contrastive learning (CL) has recently emerged as an effective approach to learning representation in a range of downstream tasks. Central to this approach is the selection of positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) sets to provide the model the opportunity to `contrast' between data and class representation in the latent space. In this paper, we investigate CL for improving model robustness using adversarial samples. We first designed and performed a comprehensive study to understand how adversarial vulnerability behaves in the latent space. Based on these empirical evidences, we propose an effective and efficient supervised contrastive learning to achieve model robustness against adversarial attacks. Moreover, we propose a new sample selection strategy that optimizes the positive/negative sets by removing redundancy and improving correlation with the anchor. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets show that our Adversarial Supervised Contrastive Learning (ASCL) approach outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses by $2.6\%$ in terms of the robust accuracy, whilst our ASCL with the proposed selection strategy can further gain $1.4\%$ improvement with only $42.8\%$ positives and $6.3\%$ negatives compared with ASCL without a selection strategy.},

abstract = {We address the problem of efficient end-to-end learning a multi-label Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on training images with partial labels. Training a CNN with partial labels, hence a small number of images for every label, using the standard cross-entropy loss is prone to overfitting and performance drop. We introduce a new loss function that regularizes the cross-entropy loss with a cost function that measures the smoothness of labels and features of images on the data manifold. Given that optimizing the new loss function over the CNN parameters requires learning similarities among labels and images, which itself depends on knowing the parameters of the CNN, we develop an efficient interactive learning framework in which the two steps of similarity learning and CNN training interact and improve the performance of each another. Our method learns the CNN parameters without requiring keeping all training data in the memory, allows to learn few informative similarities only for images in each mini-batch and handles changing feature representations. By extensive experiments on Open Images, CUB and MS-COCO datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In particular, on the large-scale Open Images dataset, we improve the state of the art by 1.02% in mAP score over 5,000 classes.},

abstract = {Recently, Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown much promise in leveraging unlabeled data while being provided with very few labels. In this paper, we show that ignoring the labels altogether for whole epochs intermittently during training can significantly improve performance in the small sample regime. More specifically, we propose to train a network on two tasks jointly. The primary classification task is exposed to both the unlabeled and the scarcely annotated data, whereas the secondary task seeks to cluster the data without any labels. As opposed to hand-crafted pretext tasks frequently used in self-supervision, our clustering phase utilizes the same classification network and head in an attempt to relax the primary task and propagate the information from the labels without overfitting them. On top of that, the self-supervised technique of classifying image rotations is incorporated during the unsupervised learning phase to stabilize training. We demonstrate our method's efficacy in boosting several state-of-the-art SSL algorithms, significantly improving their results and reducing running time in various standard semi-supervised benchmarks, including 92.6% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 96.9% on SVHN, using only 4 labels per class in each task. We also notably improve the results in the extreme cases of 1,2 and 3 labels per class, and show that features learned by our model are more meaningful for separating the data.},

abstract = {In this paper, the application of a specific system identification procedure to a municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator is discussed. This procedure is a combination of, on the one hand, a particular closed-loop identification method called the two-stage method and, on the other hand, the approach of high-order multiple input multiple output (MIMO) ARX model estimation followed by model reduction. MIMO ARX model estimation is performed by means of a, so-called, multiple data set identification method, i.e. a method by means of which it is possible to estimate a model on the basis of several data sets instead of just one data set. Model reduction is applied to each transfer function of the resulting MIMO ARX model separately. It is shown that with the proposed identification procedure a model of the MSW incinerator is obtained which, according to system identification validation measures, is good. Using the estimated model, the influence of the disturbances on the identification and control of an MSW incinerator is discussed. Furthermore, the validation of a first-principles model of the MSW incineration process by means of the resulting low-order SISO models is discussed. The results show that the proposed way of validating a first-principles model is a powerful tool for determining its quality. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {How does a 110-layer ResNet learn a high-complexity classifier using relatively few training examples and short training time? We present a theory towards explaining this in terms of hierarchical learning. We refer hierarchical learning as the learner learns to represent a compli- cated target function by decomposing it into a sequence of simpler functions to reduce sample and time complexity. This paper formally analyzes how multi-layer neural networks can perform such hierarchical learning efficiently and automatically simply by applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to the training objective. On the conceptual side, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first theory result indicating how very deep neural networks can still be sample and time efficient on certain hi- erarchical learning tasks, when no known non-hierarchical algorithms (such as kernel method, linear regression over feature mappings, tensor decomposition, sparse coding, and their simple combinations) are efficient. We establish a new principle called "backward feature correction", which we believe is the key to understand the hierarchical learning in multi-layer neural networks. On the technical side, we show for regression and even for binary classification, for every input dimension d > 0, there is a concept class consisting of degree $\omega$(1) multi-variate polyno- mials so that, using $\omega$(1)-layer neural networks as learners, SGD can learn any target function from this class in poly(d) time using poly(d) samples to any 1/poly(d) regression or classification error, through learning to represent it as a composition of $\omega$(1) layers of quadratic functions. In contrast, we present lower bounds stating that several non-hierarchical learners, including any kernel methods, neural tangent kernels, must suffer from super-polynomial d$\omega$(1)sample or time complexity to learn functions in this concept class even to any d-0.01error.},

abstract = {In recent years, due to a rise in healthy thinking on eating, many people take care of their eating habits, and some people record daily diet regularly. To assist them, many mobile applications for recording everyday meals have been released so far. Some of them employ food image recognition which can estimate not only food names but also food calorie. However, most of such applications have some problems especially on their usability. Then, in this paper, we propose a novel single-image-based food calorie estimation system which runs on a smartphone as a standalone application without external recognition servers. The proposed system carries out food region segmentation, food region categorization, and calorie estimation automatically. By the experiments and the user study on the proposed system, the effectiveness of the proposed system was confirmed.},

abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple consecutive tasks. Parameter regularization methods that constrain the parameters of the new model in order to be close to the previous model through parameter importance are effective in overcoming forgetting. Many parameter regularization methods have been tried, but each of them is only suitable for limited types of neural networks. Aimed at GANs, this paper proposes a unified framework called Memory Protection GAN (MPGAN), in which many parametrization methods can be used to overcome forgetting. The proposed framework includes two modules: Protecting Weights in Generator and Controller. In order to incorporate parameter regularization methods into MPGAN, the Protecting Weights in Generator module encapsulates different parameter regularization methods into a 'container', and consolidates the most important parameters in the generator through a parameter regularization method selected from the container. In order to differentiate tasks, the Controller module creates unique tags for the tasks. Another problem with existing parameter regularization methods is their low accuracy in measuring parameter importance. These methods always rely on the first derivative of the output function, and ignore the second derivative. To assess parameter importance more accurately, a new parameter regularization method called Second Derivative Preserver (SDP), which takes advantage of the second derivative of the output function, is designed into MPGAN. Experiments demonstrate that MPGAN is applicable to multiple parameter regularization methods and that SDP achieves high accuracy in parameter importance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on training deep neural networks capable of state-of-the-art performance without the need for the expensive over-parameterization by proposing the concept of In-Time Over-Parameterization (ITOP) in sparse training. By starting from a random sparse network and continuously exploring sparse connectivities during training, we can perform an Over-Parameterization in the space-time manifold, closing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense training. We further use ITOP to understand the underlying mechanism of Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) and indicate that the benefits of DST come from its ability to consider across time all possible parameters when searching for the optimal sparse connectivity. As long as there are sufficient parameters that have been reliably explored during training, DST can outperform the dense neural network by a large margin. We present a series of experiments to support our conjecture and achieve the state-of-the-art sparse training performance with ResNet-50 on ImageNet. More impressively, our method achieves dominant performance over the overparameterization-based sparse methods at extreme sparsity levels. When trained on CIFAR-100, our method can match the performance of the dense model even at an extreme sparsity (98%).},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks often dominate fully-connected counterparts in generalization performance, especially on image classification tasks. This is often explained in terms of 'better inductive bias'. However, this has not been made mathematically rigorous, and the hurdle is that the fully connected net can always simulate the convolutional net (for a fixed task). Thus the training algorithm plays a role. The current work describes a natural task on which a provable sample complexity gap can be shown, for standard training algorithms. We construct a single natural distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d\times\{\pm 1\}$ on which any orthogonal-invariant algorithm (i.e. fully-connected networks trained with most gradient-based methods from gaussian initialization) requires $\Omega(d^2)$ samples to generalize while $O(1)$ samples suffice for convolutional architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate a single target function, learning which on all possible distributions leads to an $O(1)$ vs $\Omega(d^2/\varepsilon)$ gap. The proof relies on the fact that SGD on fully-connected network is orthogonal equivariant. Similar results are achieved for $\ell_2$ regression and adaptive training algorithms, e.g. Adam and AdaGrad, which are only permutation equivariant.},

After capturing these features within a theoretical framework, we establish their widespread ex- istence in standard datasets.

abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 - achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features.

Launched as an alternative for\ndiesel in India, Jatropha has been promoted as a non-edible plant that\ncould grow on poor soils, yield oil-rich seeds for production of\nbio-diesel, and not compete directly with food production. Through\ninterviews with the farmers, information was gathered regarding their\nsocio-economic situation, the implementation and performance of their\nJatropha plantations, and their reasons for continuing or discontinuing\nJatropha cultivation. Results reveal that 82% of the farmers had\nsubstituted former cropland for their Jatropha cultivation. By 2010,\n85% (n = 90) of the farmers who cultivated Jatropha in 2004 had\nstopped. Cultivating the crop did not give the economic returns the\nfarmers anticipated, mainly due to a lack of information about the crop\nand its maintenance during cultivation and due to water scarcity. A\nmajority of the farmers irrigated and applied fertilizer, and even\npesticides. Many problems experienced by the farmers were due to limited\nknowledge about cultivating Jatropha caused by poor planning and\nimplementation of the national Jatropha program. Extension services,\nsubsidies, and other support were not provided as promised. The farmers\nwho continued cultivation had means of income other than Jatropha and\nheld hopes of a future Jatropha market. The lack of market structures,\nsuch as purchase agreements and buyers, as well as a low retail price\nfor the seeds, were frequently stated as barriers to Jatropha\ncultivation. For Jatropha biodiesel to perform well, efforts are needed\nto improve yield levels and stability through genetic improvements and\ndrought tolerance, as well as agriculture extension services to support\nadoption of the crop. Government programs will -probably be more\neffective if implementing biodiesel production is conjoined with\nstimulating the demand for Jatropha biodiesel. To avoid food-biofuel\ncompetition, additional measures may be needed such as land-use\nrestrictions for Jatropha producers and taxes on biofuels or biofuel\nfeedstocks to improve the competitiveness of the food sector compared to\nthe bioenergy sector.

abstract = {ImageNet has been arguably the most popular image classification benchmark, but it is also the one with a significant level of label noise. Recent studies have shown that many samples contain multiple classes, despite being assumed to be a single-label benchmark. They have thus proposed to turn ImageNet evaluation into a multi-label task, with exhaustive multi-label annotations per image. However, they have not fixed the training set, presumably because of a formidable annotation cost. We argue that the mismatch between single-label annotations and effectively multi-label images is equally, if not more, problematic in the training setup, where random crops are applied. With the single-label annotations, a random crop of an image may contain an entirely different object from the ground truth, introducing noisy or even incorrect supervision during training. We thus re-label the ImageNet training set with multi-labels. We address the annotation cost barrier by letting a strong image classifier, trained on an extra source of data, generate the multi-labels. We utilize the pixel-wise multi-label predictions before the final pooling layer, in order to exploit the additional location-specific supervision signals. Training on the re-labeled samples results in improved model performances across the board. ResNet-50 attains the top-1 classification accuracy of 78.9% on ImageNet with our localized multi-labels, which can be further boosted to 80.2% with the CutMix regularization. We show that the models trained with localized multi-labels also outperforms the baselines on transfer learning to object detection and instance segmentation tasks, and various robustness benchmarks.

Survival rates for rehabilitated oiled birds are very low despite investment of significant resources. PAHs disturb thyroid homeostasis which plays a vital role in the control of energy metabolism.

Mean plasma PAH and TSH concentrations, were 98.1Â Â±Â 8.3Â ng/ml and 0.13Â Â±Â 0.02Â ng/ml and these parameters were found to be negatively correlated (pÂ <Â 0.01) indicative of PAH-associated thyroid hormone suppression in more heavily oiled birds. Body condition and weight were also lower in birds that died compared with birds that were released. The data also show the value of measuring plasma TSH and PAH to monitor metabolic status and progress of decontamination of oiled birds in a rehabilitation setting.},

abstract = {Serious studies of the formation mechanisms of age-related pigments and their possible cellular influence have been hampered for a long time by discrepancies and controversies over the definition, fluorescence emission, origin, and composition of these pigments. This review discusses several critical controversies in this field and lay special emphasis on the cellular and biochemical reactions related to the formation mechanisms of lipofuscin, ceroid, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), and age pigment-like fluorophores (APFs). Various amino compounds and their reaction with secondary aldehydic products of oxygen free radical-induced oxidation, particularly lipid peroxidation, are important sources of the fluorophores of ceroid/lipofuscin, which progressively accumulate as a result of phagocytosis and autophagocytosis of modified biomaterials within secondary lysosomes of postmitotic and other cells. Lipofuscin is the classical age pigment of postmitotic cells, while ceroid accumulates due to pathologic and experimental processes. There are good reasons to consider both ceroid and lipofuscin as materials of the same principal origin. The age-related intracellular fluorophores of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) seems to represent a special class of lipofuscin, which partly contains derivatives of retinoids and carotenoids. Saccharide-originated fluorophores, principally AGEs formed during glycation/Maillard reactions, may be mainly responsible for the extracellular fluorescence of long-lived proteins, such as collagen, elastin, and lens crystalline. Although lipofuscin, ceroid, AGEs, and APFs can be produced from different types of biological materials due to different side reactions of essential biology, the crosslinking of carbonyl-amino compounds is recognized as a common process during their formation.},

abstract = {While recent studies on semi-supervised learning have shown remarkable progress in leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, most of them presume a basic setting of the model is randomly initialized. In this work, we consider semi-supervised learning and transfer learning jointly, leading to a more practical and competitive paradigm that can utilize both powerful pre-trained models from source domain as well as labeled/unlabeled data in the target domain. To better exploit the value of both pre-trained weights and unlabeled target examples, we introduce adaptive consistency regularization that consists of two complementary components: Adaptive Knowledge Consistency (AKC) on the examples between the source and target model, and Adaptive Representation Consistency (ARC) on the target model between labeled and unlabeled examples. Examples involved in the consistency regularization are adaptively selected according to their potential contributions to the target task. We conduct extensive experiments on several popular benchmarks including CUB-200-2011, MIT Indoor-67, MURA, by fine-tuning the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-50 model. Results show that our proposed adaptive consistency regularization outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques such as Pseudo Label, Mean Teacher, and MixMatch. Moreover, our algorithm is orthogonal to existing methods and thus able to gain additional improvements on top of MixMatch and FixMatch.

Previous methods observing diverse paths require multiple training runs. In contrast we aim to leverage both property (1) and (2) with a single method and in a single training run. With a similar computational cost as training one model, we learn lines, curves, and simplexes of high-accuracy neural networks. These neural network subspaces contain diverse solutions that can be ensembled, approaching the ensemble performance of independently trained networks without the training cost. Moreover, using the subspace midpoint boosts accuracy, calibration, and robustness to label noise, outperforming Stochastic Weight Averaging.},

abstract = {Solvent Technology, is gaining the interest of researchers in improving transesterification process recently. Transesterification of cotton seed oil into biodiesel using different mixtures of methanol with Diethyl Ether (DEE), Dichlorobenzene (CBN) or Acetone (ACT) co-solvent systems was conducted. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) was used as the catalyst all through. The reaction conditions optimized include; the molar ratio of co-solvent in methanol, reaction temperature and time. The catalyst concentration was also optimized. The optimization was based on the percentage yields of Fatty Acids Methyl Esters (FAMEs) produced. In addition, the effects of co-solvent systems on physico-chemical properties (Acid value and fatty acids composition) and fuel properties (viscosity, density and calorific value) were investigated as well. The result obtained, indicated 10% (v/v) addition of co-solvents CBN and ACT in methanol was the optimal volume. The optimal reaction temperature was 55 Â°0C for 10 min when the catalyst concentration of 0.75% (w/w) weight of oil was used. Fuel properties were within the acceptable limit of ASTM and not significantly affected by the co-solvent systems except for the calorific value. It was concluded that the addition of co-solvent reduced the reaction time and improved some fuel properties of the biodiesel produced. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In particular it is clear that living on low incomes did generate anxiety and low self-esteem for a significant number of research participants, with detrimental impacts on their psychological wellbeing (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009; Frost and Hoggett, 2008; Ridge, 2009; Hopper et al, 2007; Orr et al, 2006; Ghate and Hazel, 2004; Reay, 2005; Wilkinson, 1996). Our study also found that part of the explanation for these detrimental impacts on self-esteem and emotional wellbeing arises from the internalisation of personal critique, self-blame and a sense of not being clever or resourceful enough to manage the consequences of living on a lower income (Bourdieu, 1984; Skeggs, 1994; Dolan, 2007; Orton, 2009; Blokland, 2007). This is an important contextual caveat to the sense of self worth and relative contentment found by Pahl et al, (2007). This focus of self-critique provides one possible explanation for the âquiescence' (Pahl et al, 2007: 1) within unequal societies. Our findings indicate that underclass concepts (of different cultural values, indolence and dependency alleged to pervade some communities in âBroken Britain') are inherently flawed, although they continue to be been espouse, most recently in Prime Minister David Cameron's rationales for the Big Society (Cameron, 2010) Indeed, the centrality of a proactive management of individuals' circumstances to their self-identity and their perceived duty to contribute to society was striking. However, our findings also suggest that the impact of stigmatisation upon the identities and behaviour of lower income households may be more limited than previous research suggests. This is not to say that mechanisms of distinction and denigration of particular groups were not present within the neighbourhoods- they were. But this denigration was driven as much by historical working class values as other sources, such as the media and policy discourses.},

At 1 h of reaction time, yield of FAME was 93% for CaO, 12% for Ca(OH)2, and 0% for CaCO3. Under the same reacting condition, sodium hydroxide with the homogeneous catalysis brought about the complete conversion into FAME. Also, CaO was used for the further tests transesterifying waste cooking oil (WCO) with acid value of 5.1 mg-KOH/g. The yield of FAME was above 99% at 2 h of reaction time, but a portion of catalyst changed into calcium soap by reacting with free fatty acids included in WCO at initial stage of the transesterification. Owing to the neutralizing reaction of the catalyst, concentration of calcium in FAME increased from 187 ppm to 3065 ppm. By processing WCO at reflux of methanol in the presence of cation-exchange resin, only the free fatty acids could be converted into FAME. The transesterification of the processed WCO with acid value of 0.3 mg-KOH/g resulted in the production of FAME including calcium of 565 ppm. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

When trained on one task, then trained on a second task, many machine learning models âforgetâ how to perform the first task. This is widely believed to be a serious problem for neural networks. Here, we investigate the extent to which the catastrophic forgetting problem occurs for modern neural networks, comparing both established and recent gradient-based training algorithms and activation functions. We also examine the effect of the relationship between the first task and the second task on catastrophic forgetting. We find that it is always best to train using the dropout algorithmâthe dropout algorithm is consistently best at adapting to the new task, remembering the old task, and has the best tradeoff curve between these two extremes. We find that different tasks and relationships between tasks result in very different rankings of activation function performance. This suggests that the choice of activation function should always be cross-validated.},

abstract = {Recent work has shown how predictive modeling can endow agents with rich knowledge of their surroundings, improving their ability to act in complex environments. We propose question-answering as a general paradigm to decode and understand the representations that such agents develop, applying our method to two recent approaches to predictive modeling â action-conditional CPC (Guo et al., 2018) and SimCore (Gregor et al., 2019). After training agents with these predictive objectives in a visually-rich, 3D environment with an assortment of objects, colors, shapes, and spatial configurations, we probe their internal state representations with synthetic (English) questions, without backpropagating gradients from the question-answering decoder into the agent. The performance of different agents when probed this way reveals that they learn to encode factual, and seemingly compositional, information about objects, properties and spatial relations from their physical environment. Our approach is intuitive, i.e. humans can easily interpret responses of the model as opposed to inspecting continuous vectors, and model-agnostic, i.e. applicable to any modeling approach. By revealing the implicit knowledge of objects, quantities, properties and relations acquired by agents as they learn, question-conditional agent probing can stimulate the design and development of stronger predictive learning objectives.},

By utilizing the proximal gradient descent method for learning, the exact sparsity and freezing of the model is guaranteed, and thus, the learner can explicitly control the model capacity as the learning continues. Furthermore, as a critical detail, we re-initialize the weights associated with unimportant nodes after learning each task in order to prevent the negative transfer that causes the catastrophic forgetting and facilitate efficient learning of new tasks. Throughout the extensive experimental results, we show that our AGS-CL uses much less additional memory space for storing the regularization parameters, and it significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on representative continual learning benchmarks for both supervised and reinforcement learning tasks.},

However, representations used for transfer are usually generic, and are not tailored to a particular distribution of downstream tasks. We explore the use of expert representations for transfer with a simple, yet effective, strategy. We train a diverse set of experts by exploiting existing label structures, and use cheap-to-compute performance proxies to select the relevant expert for each target task. This strategy scales the process of transferring to new tasks, since it does not revisit the pre-training data during transfer. Accordingly, it requires little extra compute per target task, and results in a speed-up of 2â3 orders of magnitude compared to competing approaches. Further, we provide an adapter-based architecture able to compress many experts into a single model. We evaluate our approach on two different data sources and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines on over 20 diverse vision tasks in both cases.},

Cognition is core to tasks that involve not just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world. However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand the interactions and relationships between objects in an image. When asked "What vehicle is the person riding?", computers will need to identify the objects in an image as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and pulling(horse, carriage) in order to answer correctly that "the person is riding a horse-drawn carriage". In this paper, we present the Visual Genome dataset to enable the modeling of such relationships. We collect dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships within each image to learn these models. Specifically, our dataset contains over 100K images where each image has an average of 21 objects, 18 attributes, and 18 pairwise relationships between objects. We canonicalize the objects, attributes, relationships, and noun phrases in region descriptions and questions answer pairs to WordNet synsets. Together, these annotations represent the densest and largest dataset of image descriptions, objects, attributes, relationships, and question answers.},

We train on a million images, with simulated user inputs. To guide the user towards efficient input selection, the system recommends likely colors based on the input image and current user inputs. The colorization is performed in a single feed-forward pass, enabling real-time use. Even with randomly simulated user inputs, we show that the proposed system helps novice users quickly create realistic colorizations, and offers large improvements in colorization quality with just a minute of use. In addition, we demonstrate that the framework can incorporate other user "hints" to the desired colorization, showing an application to color histogram transfer.

abstract = {Visual understanding goes well beyond object recognition. With one glance at an image, we can effortlessly imagine the world beyond the pixels: For instance, we can infer people's actions, goals, and mental states. While this task is easy for humans, it is tremendously difficult for today's vision systems, requiring higher-order cognition and commonsense reasoning about the world. We formalize this task as Visual Commonsense Reasoning. Given a challenging question about an image, a machine must answer correctly and then provide a rationale justifying its answer. Next, we introduce a new dataset, VCR, consisting of 290k multiple choice QA problems derived from 110k movie scenes. The key recipe for generating non-trivial and high-quality problems at scale is Adversarial Matching, a new approach to transform rich annotations into multiple choice questions with minimal bias. Experimental results show that while humans find VCR easy (over 90% accuracy), state-of-the-art vision models struggle ($\sim$45%). To move towards cognition-level understanding, we present a new reasoning engine, Recognition to Cognition Networks (R2C), that models the necessary layered inferences for grounding, contextualization, and reasoning. R2C helps narrow the gap between humans and machines ($\sim$65%); still, the challenge is far from solved, and we provide analysis that suggests avenues for future work.},

abstract = {For artificial general intelligence (AGI) it would be efficient if multiple users trained the same giant neural network, permitting parameter reuse, without catastrophic forgetting. PathNet is a first step in this direction. It is a neural network algorithm that uses agents embedded in the neural network whose task is to discover which parts of the network to re-use for new tasks. Agents are pathways (views) through the network which determine the subset of parameters that are used and updated by the forwards and backwards passes of the backpropogation algorithm. During learning, a tournament selection genetic algorithm is used to select pathways through the neural network for replication and mutation. Pathway fitness is the performance of that pathway measured according to a cost function. We demonstrate successful transfer learning; fixing the parameters along a path learned on task A and re-evolving a new population of paths for task B, allows task B to be learned faster than it could be learned from scratch or after fine-tuning. Paths evolved on task B re-use parts of the optimal path evolved on task A. Positive transfer was demonstrated for binary MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN supervised learning classification tasks, and a set of Atari and Labyrinth reinforcement learning tasks, suggesting PathNets have general applicability for neural network training. Finally, PathNet also significantly improves the robustness to hyperparameter choices of a parallel asynchronous reinforcement learning algorithm (A3C).},

The article further explains how these conditions and components may lead to outcomes of spir-itual experiences, spiritual well-being, and leisure-spiritual coping. Leisure-spiritual coping, which is particularly relevant for persons who are experiencing stress, refers to spiritual coping that takes place within the context of a person's leisure. This model illustrates the complexity of the nature-based recreation and spirituality re-lationship.

Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines.

@article{Singpurwalla2004,
abstract = { The notion of fuzzy sets has proven useful in the context of control theory, pattern recognition, and medical diagnosis. However, it has also spawned the view that classical probability theory is unable to deal with uncertainties in natural language and machine learning, so that alternatives to probability are needed. One such alternative is what is known as ``possibility theory.'' Such alternatives have come into being because past attempts at making fuzzy set theory and probability theory work in concert have been unsuccessful. The purpose of this article is to develop a line of argument that demonstrates that probability theory has a sufficiently rich structure for incorporating fuzzy sets within its framework. Thus probabilities of fuzzy events can be logically induced. The philosophical underpinnings that make this happen are a subjectivistic interpretation of probability, an introduction of Laplace's famous genie, and the mathematics of encoding expert testimony. The benefit of making probability theory work in concert with fuzzy set theory is an ability to deal with different kinds of uncertainties that may arise within the same problem. },

Thus, this paper reviewed direct transmittance degradation works of PV module surface glasses, and employed several integrated and improved experiment and model methods to investigate the correlation effects of PM2.5 deposition dynamics, tilt angles, surface conditions and self-cleaning TiO2nanocoating on glasses. Series of physical models from ambient aerosol concentration to deposition density and transmittance reduction were extended or newly developed. Measured and modeled data could inter-validate with each other and literature results. The usage condition of Al-Hasan model was discovered as 0<ap<0.10 for particle projected-area fraction under clustering particle projected-area fraction apcpâ¤5%. Ranging from 0 to 18.7 $\mu$g/cm2, deposition densities with the most reductions (50â91%) were found under the combination of wet and nanocoating conditions due to effects of water film and low adhesive force. Generally, the average deposition densities decreased 19â47% with the increase of each 30Â° tilt angle for different surface properties. Finally, six linear empirical models were obtained with decreasing slopes of 0.001544â0.001841 between fine aerosol deposition density and transmittance ratio. These observed phenomena and derived models would be useful for solar energy, building illumination or heat-transfer, and BIPV industries.},

The model predicts a net-water-per-proton flux ratio of 0.2 H2O/H+ under typical operating conditions, which is much less than the measured electro-osmotic drag coefficient for a fully hydrated membrane.

On the other hand, solutions are based mostly on fuzzy AR time series models in the fuzzy time series literature. However, just a few fuzzy ARMA time series models have proposed until now. Fuzzy AR time series models have been divided into two groups named first order and high order models in the literature, highlighting the impact of model degree on forecast performance. However, model structure has been disregarded in these fuzzy AR models. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate the model specification error arising from not utilizing of MA variables in the fuzzy time series approaches. For this reason, a new high order fuzzy ARMA(p,q) time series solution algorithm based on fuzzy logic group relations including fuzzy MA variables along with fuzzy AR variables has been proposed in this study. The main purpose of this article is to show that the forecast performance can be significantly improved when the deficiency of not utilizing MA variables. The other aim is also to show that the proposed method is better than the other fuzzy ARMA time series models in the literature from the point of forecast performance. Therefore, the new proposed method has been compared regarding forecast performance against some methods commonly used in literature by applying them on gold prices in Turkey, Istanbul Stock Exchange (IMKB) and the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX).},

To this end, the accurate forecasting of wind power is considered as an important and influential factor for the management and planning of power systems. In this paper, a novel intelligent method is proposed to provide an accurate forecast of the medium-term and long-term wind power by using the uncertain data from an online supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and the numerical weather prediction (NWP). This new method is based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and applied to train the Type-2 fuzzy neural network (T2FNN) which is called T2FNN-PSO. The presented method combines both of fuzzy system's expert knowledge and the neural network's learning capability for accurate forecasting of the wind power. In addition, the T2FNN-PSO can appropriately handle the uncertainties associated with the measured parameters from SCADA system, the numerical weather prediction and measuring tools. The proposed method is applied on a case study of a real wind farm. The obtained simulation results validate effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method for a practical solution to an accurate wind power forecasting in a power system control center.},

Naturally, few-shot learning has been one of the most popular applications for meta-learning. However, existing meta-learning algorithms rarely consider the time and resource efficiency or the generalization capacity for unknown datasets, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose MetaDelta, a novel practical meta-learning system for the few-shot image classification. MetaDelta consists of two core components: i) multiple meta-learners supervised by a central controller to ensure efficiency, and ii) a meta-ensemble module in charge of integrated inference and better generalization. In particular, each meta-learner in MetaDelta is composed of a unique pretrained encoder fine-tuned by batch training and parameter-free decoder used for prediction.

abstract = {Humans accumulate knowledge in a lifelong fashion. Modern deep neural networks, on the other hand, are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting: when adapted to perform new tasks, they often fail to preserve their performance on previously learned tasks. Given a sequence of tasks, a naive approach addressing catastrophic forgetting is to train a separate standalone model for each task, which scales the total number of parameters drastically without efficiently utilizing previous models. In contrast, we propose a parameter efficient framework, Piggyback GAN, which learns the current task by building a set of convolutional and deconvolutional filters that are factorized into filters of the models trained on previous tasks. For the current task, our model achieves high generation quality on par with a standalone model at a lower number of parameters. For previous tasks, our model can also preserve generation quality since the filters for previous tasks are not altered. We validate Piggyback GAN on various image-conditioned generation tasks across different domains, and provide qualitative and quantitative results to show that the proposed approach can address catastrophic forgetting effectively and efficiently.},

abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, populationbased genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance. We demonstrate the latter by showing that combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g. DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA is faster than ES, A3C, and DQN (it can train Atari in â¼4 hours on one desktop or â¼1 hour distributed on 720 cores), and enables a stateof-the-art, up to 10,000-fold compact encoding technique.},

abstract = {Do moral judgments hinge on the time available to render them? According to a recent dual-process model of moral judgment, moral dilemmas that engage emotional processes are likely to result in fast deontological gut reactions. In contrast, consequentialist responses that tot up lives saved and lost in response to such dilemmas would require cognitive control to override the initial response. Cognitive control, however, takes time. In two experiments, we manipulated the time available to arrive at moral judgments in two ways: by allotting a fixed short or large amount of time, and by nudging people to answer swiftly or to deliberate thoroughly. We found that faster responses indeed lead to more deontological responses among those moral dilemmas in which the killing of one to save many necessitates manhandling an innocent person and in which this action is depicted as a means to an end. Thus, our results are the first demonstration that inhibiting cognitive control through manipulations of time alters moral judgments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A novel, speckle noise reduction algorithm based on the combination of Anisotropic Diffusion (AD) filtering and Interval Type-II fuzzy sets was developed for reducing speckle noise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. Unlike regular AD, the new Type-II fuzzy AD algorithm considers the uncertainty in the calculated diffusion coefficient and appropriate adjustments to the coefficient are made. The new algorithm offers flexibility in optimizing the trade-off between two of the image metrics: signal-to-noise (SNR) and Edginess, which are directly related to the structure of the imaged object. Application of the Type-II fuzzy AD algorithm to OCT tomograms acquired in-vivo from a human finger tip and human retina show reduction in the speckle noise with very little edge blurring and about 13 dB and 7 dB image SNR improvement respectively. Comparison with Wiener, Adaptive Lee and regular AD filters, applied to the same images, demonstrates the superior performance of the Type-II fuzzy AD algorithm in terms image SNR and edge preservation metrics improvement.},

abstract = {Batch normalization is a key component of most image classification models, but it has many undesirable properties stemming from its dependence on the batch size and interactions between examples. Although recent work has succeeded in training deep ResNets without normalization layers, these models do not match the test accuracies of the best batch-normalized networks, and are often unstable for large learning rates or strong data augmentations. In this work, we develop an adaptive gradient clipping technique which overcomes these instabilities, and design a significantly improved class of Normalizer-Free ResNets. Our smaller models match the test accuracy of an EfficientNet-B7 on ImageNet while being up to 8.7x faster to train, and our largest models attain a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 86.5%. In addition, Normalizer-Free models attain significantly better performance than their batch-normalized counterparts when finetuning on ImageNet after large-scale pre-training on a dataset of 300 million labeled images, with our best models obtaining an accuracy of 89.2%.

abstract = {The application of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has certainly helped to improve our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for clinical disability and cognitive impairment in this condition.The numerous studies performed in MS patients have also provided many lessons on the structure-function relationships in the human brain, which could be applied to healthy subjects and to patients affected by other neurological conditions. The findings have allowed a better understanding of the processes involved in the loss of function after central nervous system (CNS) damage, and clarified the substrates of specific symptoms (e.g., cognitive impairment and fatigue), which should aid clinical recovery and help in the monitoring of disease progression.In this review, important examples of how the application of different MRI techniques in MS might provide relevant information on the human brain are discussed. These include how damage to strategic white matter tracts can cause symptoms due to a disconnection mechanism and how involvement of a specific brain network, independent of the underlying pathological substrate, might determine certain symptoms. The role of functional and structural plasticity in clinical recovery (following an acute relapse or promoted by rehabilitation) and the mechanisms that might become the target of treatment aimed at function recovery are also considered. The ways in which network- and system-based analysis can reshape current understanding of the brain structure-function relationships are discussed. Finally, there is speculation about the relevance of inherited or acquired factors, such as age, comorbidity, brain reserve and cognitive reserve, which are likely to influence the relation between CNS damage and disease clinical manifestations.},

We attempted to resolve these conflicts by examining relationships of attentional abilities with responding to predictable and unpredictable threat â related but distinct motivational process implicated in a number of anxiety disorders. Eighty-one individuals completed a behavioral task assessing efficiency of three components of attention â alerting, orienting, and executive control (Attention Network Test - Revised). We also assessed startle responding during anticipation of both predictable, imminent threat (of mild electric shock) and unpredictable contextual threat. Faster alerting and slower disengaging from non-emotional attention cues were related to heightened responding to unpredictable threat, whereas poorer executive control of attention was related to heightened responding to predictable threat. This double dissociation helps to integrate models of attention and anxiety and may be informative for treatment development.},

Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

Logic rules provide interpretable explanations when used for prediction as well as being able to generalize to other tasks, and hence are critical to learn. Existing methods either suffer from the problem of searching in a large search space (e.g., neural logic programming) or ineffective optimization due to sparse rewards (e.g., techniques based on reinforcement learning). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a probabilistic model called RNNLogic. RNNLogic treats logic rules as a latent variable, and simultaneously trains a rule generator as well as a reasoning predictor with logic rules. We develop an EM-based algorithm for optimization. In each iteration, the reasoning predictor is updated to explore some generated logic rules for reasoning. Then in the E-step, we select a set of high-quality rules from all generated rules with both the rule generator and reasoning predictor via posterior inference; and in the M-step, the rule generator is updated with the rules selected in the E-step. Experiments on four datasets prove the effectiveness of RNNLogic.},

abstract = {While deep learning has led to remarkable advances across diverse applications, it struggles in domains where the data distribution changes over the course of learning. In stark contrast, biological neural networks continually adapt to changing domains, possibly by leveraging complex molecular machinery to solve many tasks simultaneously. In this study, we introduce intelligent synapses that bring some of this biological complexity into artificial neural networks. Each synapse accumulates task relevant information over time, and exploits this information to rapidly store new memories without forgetting old ones. We evaluate our approach on continual learning of classification tasks, and show that it dramatically reduces forgetting while maintaining computational efficiency.},

abstract = {Cross-domain analogies are a powerful method for learning new domains. This paper extends the Domain Transfer via Analogy (DTA) method with persistent mappings, correspondences between domains that are incrementally built up as a cognitive system gains experience with a new domain. DTA uses analogies between pairs of textbook example problems, or worked solutions, to create a domain mapping between a familiar and a new domain. This mapping enables the initialization of a new domain theory. Another analogy is then made between the domain theories themselves, providing additional conjectures about the new domain. After these conjectures are verified, the successful mappings are stored as persistent mappings to constrain future analogies between the domains. We show that DTA plus persistent mappings enables a Companion, the first structure mapping cognitive architecture, to learn the equation schemas and control knowledge necessary to solve problems in three domains (rotational mechanics, electricity, and heat) by analogy with linear mechanics. We provide a detailed analysis categorizing transfer failures. As with people, the most difficult step in cross-domain analogy is identifying an appropriate example. Once an analogous example has been found, DTA successfully transfers the domain knowledge necessary to solve the problem in the new domain 78% of the time. Furthermore, we illustrate how persistent mappings assist in retrieval of analogous examples and overcoming two types of mapping failures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Neural networks have achieved success in a wide array of perceptual tasks, but it is often stated that they are incapable of solving tasks that require higher-level reasoning. Two new task domains, CLEVRER and CATER, have recently been developed to focus on reasoning, as opposed to perception, in the context of spatio-temporal interactions between objects. Initial experiments on these domains found that neuro-symbolic approaches, which couple a logic engine and language parser with a neural perceptual front-end, substantially outperform fully-learned distributed networks, a finding that was taken to support the above thesis. Here, we show on the contrary that a fully-learned neural network with the right inductive biases can perform substantially better than all previous neural-symbolic models on both of these tasks, particularly on questions that most emphasize reasoning over perception. Our model makes critical use of both self-attention and learned "soft" object-centric representations, as well as BERT-style semi-supervised predictive losses. These flexible biases allow our model to surpass the previous neuro-symbolic state-of-the-art using less than 60% of available labelled data. Together, these results refute the neuro-symbolic thesis laid out by previous work involving these datasets, and they provide evidence that neural networks can indeed learn to reason effectively about the causal, dynamic structure of physical events.},

First, the formulas for obtaining the fuzzy maximal eigenvalue of a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix proposed by Csutora & Buckley (2001) and by Ishizaka (2014) are reviewed, and the flaws in their formulas regarding the violation of the reciprocity of pairwise comparisons are pointed out. New formulas for obtaining the fuzzy maximal eigenvalue preserving the reciprocity of pairwise comparisons are then proposed. After, a fuzzy extension of Saaty's Consistency Index and Consistency Ratio is introduced in order to verify an acceptable level of inconsistency of a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix. Further, the methods for obtaining the fuzzy maximal eigenvector corresponding to the fuzzy maximal eigenvalue of a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix proposed by Wang & Chin (2006) and by Ishizaka (2014) are reviewed. The flaws in Ishizaka's method are pointed out, and Wang & Chin's method is studied and modified in order to preserve the reciprocity of pairwise comparisons. The fuzzy maximal eigenvalues and the corresponding fuzzy maximal eigenvectors obtained by the new formulas are confronted with those obtained by methods proposed by Csutora & Buckley (2001), Wang & Chin (2006) and Ishizaka (2014), and three numerical examples are given for better illustration.},

abstract = {Although depth extraction with passive sensors has seen remarkable improvement with deep learning, these approaches may fail to obtain correct depth if they are exposed to environments not observed during training. Online adaptation, where the neural network trains while deployed, with unsupervised learning provides a convenient solution. However, online adaptation causes a neural network to forget the past. Thus, past training is wasted and the network is not able to provide good results if it observes past scenes. This work deals with practical online-adaptation where the input is online and temporally-correlated, and training is completely unsupervised. Regularization and replay-based methods without task boundaries are proposed to avoid catastrophic forgetting while adapting to online data. Experiments are performed on different datasets with both structure-from-motion and stereo. Results of forgetting as well as adaptation are provided, which are superior to recent methods. The proposed approach is more inline with the artificial general intelligence paradigm as the neural network learns the scene where it is deployed without any supervision (target labels and tasks) and without forgetting about the past.

The Web-based Speaking Test in English for Tourism (WBST-EFT) and a coding scheme were used as research instruments. Descriptive statistics, the Man-Whitney U test, percentages, and qualitative content analysis from verbal reports were used in the data analysis. The findings showed that the two proficiency groups significantly and differently reported cognitive and metacognitive strategies for this LSP online speaking test. The qualitative results indicated that high-proficiency students used more complex details in all of the sub-strategies than the low-proficiency students. Low-proficiency students should be trained to effectively employ these strategies to improve their LSP speaking ability through the use of an online LSP speaking test that has been considered as an effective tool and that provides an opportunity for students to self-assess and self-practice their performances. Both strategies and online speaking tools can be used with a large number of students to develop LSP speaking ability in tourism.},

abstract = {We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that are discrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence. Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence [1] and Neural Turing Machines [2], because the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems - finding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem - using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete problems.},

We employed a Stroop-like paradigm, in which two familiar objects were presented at different visual sizes on the screen. Observers were faster to indicate which was bigger or smaller on the screen when the real-world size of the objects was congruent with the visual size than when it was incongruent-demonstrating a familiar-size Stroop effect. Critically, the real-world size of the objects was irrelevant for the task. This Stroop effect was also present when only one item was present at a congruent or incongruent visual size on the display. In contrast, no Stroop effect was observed for participants who simply learned a rule to categorize novel objects as big or small. These results show that people access the familiar size of objects without the intention of doing so, demonstrating that real-world size is an automatic property of object representation. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Psychological Association.},

Commonly used approaches for real-time training diagnostics, such as monitoring the train/test loss, are limited. Assessing a network's training process solely through these performance indicators is akin to debugging software without access to internal states through a debugger. To address this, we present Cockpit, a collection of instruments that enable a closer look into the inner workings of a learning machine, and a more informative and meaningful status report for practitioners. It facilitates the identification of learning phases and failure modes, like ill-chosen hyperparameters. These instruments leverage novel higher-order information about the gradient distribution and curvature, which has only recently become efficiently accessible. We believe that such a debugging tool, which we open-source for PyTorch, represents an important step to improve troubleshooting the training process, reveal new insights, and help develop novel methods and heuristics.},

In this paper, a novel method, robust to pose, illumination variations, and occlusions is pro-posed for joint face frontalization and landmark localization. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods for landmark localiza-tion and pose correction, where large amount of manually annotated images or 3D facial models are required, the pro-posed method relies on a small set of frontal images only. By observing that the frontal facial image of both humans and animals, is the one having the minimum rank of all different poses, a model which is able to jointly recover the frontalized version of the face as well as the facial landmarks is devised. To this end, a suitable optimization problem is solved, con-cerning minimization of the nuclear norm (convex surrogate of the rank function) and the matrix 1 norm accounting for occlusions. The proposed method is assessed in frontal view reconstruction of human and animal faces, landmark localization, pose-invariant face recognition, face verifica-tion in unconstrained conditions, and video inpainting by conducting experiment on 9 databases. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods for the target problems.},

In this work, we investigate the efficiency of current lifelong approaches, in terms of sample complexity, computational and memory cost. Towards this end, we first introduce a new and a more realistic evaluation protocol, whereby learners observe each example only once and hyper-parameter selection is done on a small and disjoint set of tasks, which is not used for the actual learning experience and evaluation. Second, we introduce a new metric measuring how quickly a learner acquires a new skill. Third, we propose an improved version of GEM (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017), dubbed Averaged GEM (A-GEM), which enjoys the same or even better performance as GEM, while being almost as computationally and memory efficient as EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016) and other regularization-based methods. Finally, we show that all algorithms including A-GEM can learn even more quickly if they are provided with task descriptors specifying the classification tasks under consideration. Our experiments on several standard lifelong learning benchmarks demonstrate that A-GEM has the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.1},

abstract = {Pinpointing subcellular protein localizations from microscopy images is easy to the trained eye, but challenging to automate. Based on the Human Protein Atlas image collection, we held a competition to identify deep learning solutions to solve this task. Challenges included training on highly imbalanced classes and predicting multiple labels per image. Over 3 months, 2,172 teams participated. Despite convergence on popular networks and training techniques, there was considerable variety among the solutions. Participants applied strategies for modifying neural networks and loss functions, augmenting data and using pretrained networks. The winning models far outperformed our previous effort at multi-label classification of protein localization patterns by $\sim$20%. These models can be used as classifiers to annotate new images, feature extractors to measure pattern similarity or pretrained networks for a wide range of biological applications.},

abstract = {The success of deep learning in numerous application domains created the desire to run and train them on mobile devices. This however, conflicts with their computationally, memory and energy intense nature, leading to a growing interest in compression. Recent work by Han et al. (2015a) propose a pipeline that involves retraining, pruning and quantization of neural network weights, obtaining state-of-the-art compression rates. In this paper, we show that competitive compression rates can be achieved by using a version ofâsoft weight-sharingâ (Nowlan & Hinton, 1992). Our method achieves both quantization and pruning in one simple (re-)training procedure. This point of view also exposes the relation between compression and the minimum description length (MDL) principle.},

abstract = {Continual learning methods with fixed architectures rely on a single network to learn models that can perform well on all tasks. As a result, they often only accommodate common features of those tasks but neglect each task's specific features. On the other hand, dynamic architecture methods can have a separate network for each task, but they are too expensive to train and not scalable in practice, especially in online settings. To address this problem, we propose a novel online continual learning method named âContextual Transformation Networksâ (CTN) to efficiently model the task-specific features while enjoying neglectable complexity overhead compared to other fixed architecture methods. Moreover, inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory, we propose a novel dual memory design and an objective to train CTN that can address both catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer simultaneously. Our extensive experiments show that CTN is competitive with a large scale dynamic architecture network and consistently outperforms other fixed architecture methods under the same standard backbone. We will release our implementation upon acceptance.},

Marine management relies on scientific knowledge and expertise but is also inherently political, as it deals with aspects of resource access. Both local knowledge of practitioners and stakeholders' world views, values, and perceptions are important, adding to the scientific knowledge base and to understanding the management context. This chapter synthesizes existing literature and reviews on stakeholder participation. We analyze two marine management cases using eight key features of participation. The analyses illustrate that a participatory process can still not be successful if an underpinning participatory philosophy and clear objectives are lacking, participation is delayed and not well institutionalized. Clarity is needed about the participatory philosophy and process objective. The goal can be sharing knowledge or negotiating a decision. The increased need of stakeholder knowledge requires clarity about which of the two is driving the process. Rules of the game, including roles, responsibilities, and mandate need to be clear to all participants from the beginning.},

Chemically biodiesel is monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from renewable feed stock like vegetable oils and animal fats. It is produced by transesterification in which, oil or fat is reacted with a monohydric alcohol in presence of a catalyst. The process of transesterification is affected by the mode of reaction condition, molar ratio of alcohol to oil, type of alcohol, type and amount of catalysts, reaction time and temperature and purity of reactants. In the present paper various methods of preparation of biodiesel with different combination of oil and catalysts have been described. The technical tools and processes for monitoring the transesterification reactions like TLC, GC, HPLC, GPC,1H NMR and NIR have also been summarized. In addition, fuel properties and specifications provided by different countries are discussed.},

abstract = {Recently, technologies such as face detection, facial landmark localisation and face recognition and verification have matured enough to provide effective and efficient solutions for imagery captured under arbitrary conditions (referred to as "in-the-wild"). This is partially attributed to the fact that comprehensive "in-the-wild" benchmarks have been developed for face detection, landmark localisation and recognition/verification. A very important technology that has not been thoroughly evaluated yet is deformable face tracking "in-the-wild". Until now, the performance has mainly been assessed qualitatively by visually assessing the result of a deformable face tracking technology on short videos. In this paper, we perform the first, to the best of our knowledge, thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art deformable face tracking pipelines using the recently introduced 300VW benchmark. We evaluate many different architectures focusing mainly on the task of on-line deformable face tracking. In particular, we compare the following general strategies: (a) generic face detection plus generic facial landmark localisation, (b) generic model free tracking plus generic facial landmark localisation, as well as (c) hybrid approaches using state-of-the-art face detection, model free tracking and facial landmark localisation technologies. Our evaluation reveals future avenues for further research on the topic.},

However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a sweet spot of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural networks performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks. Our work opens new directions for the design of neural architectures and the understanding on neural networks in general.},

GLOM answers the question: How can a neural network with a fixed architecture parse an image into a part-whole hierarchy which has a different structure for each image? The idea is simply to use islands of identical vectors to represent the nodes in the parse tree. If GLOM can be made to work, it should significantly improve the interpretability of the representations produced by transformer-like systems when applied to vision or language},

In this work, we identify another such aspect: we find that adversarially robust models, while less accurate, often perform better than their standard-trained counterparts when used for transfer learning. Specifically, we focus on adversarially robust ImageNet classifiers, and show that they yield improved accuracy on a standard suite of downstream classification tasks. Further analysis uncovers more differences between robust and standard models in the context of transfer learning. Our results are consistent with (and in fact, add to) recent hypotheses stating that robustness leads to improved feature representations.

abstract = {The behavior composition problem amounts to realizing a virtual desired module (e.g., a surveillance agent system) by suitably coordinating (and re-purposing) the execution of a set of available modules (e.g., a video camera, vacuum cleaner, a robot, etc.). In particular, we investigate techniques to synthesize a controller implementing a fully controllable target behavior by suitably coordinating available partially controllable behaviors that are to execute within a shared, fully observable, but partially predictable (i.e., non-deterministic), environment. Both behaviors and environment are represented as arbitrary finite state transition systems. The technique we propose is directly based on the idea that the controller job is to coordinate the concurrent execution of the available behaviors so as to "mimic" the target behavior. To this end, we exploit a variant of the formal notion of simulation to formally capture the notion of "mimicking", and we show that the technique proposed is sound and complete, optimal with respect to computational complexity, and robust for different kind of system failures. In addition, we demonstrate that the technique is well suited for highly efficient implementation based on synthesis by model checking technologies, by relating the problem to that of finding a winning strategy in a special safety game and explaining how to actually solve it using an existing verification tool. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Elastic weight consolidation (EWC) has been successfully applied for general incremental learning to overcome the catastrophic forgetting issue. It adaptively constrains each parameter of the new model not to deviate much from its counterpart in the old model during fine-tuning on new class data sets, according to its importance weight for old tasks. However, the previous study demonstrates that it still suffers from catastrophic forgetting when directly used in object detection. In this article, we show EWC is effective for incremental object detection if with critical adaptations. First, we conduct controlled experiments to identify two core issues why EWC fails if trivially applied to incremental detection: 1) the absence of old class annotations in new class images makes EWC misclassify objects of old classes in these images as background and 2) the quadratic regularization loss in EWC easily leads to gradient explosion when balancing old and new classes. Then, based on the abovementioned findings, we propose the corresponding solutions to tackle these issues: 1) utilize pseudobounding box annotations of old classes on new data sets to compensate for the absence of old class annotations and 2) adopt a novel Huber regularization instead of the original quadratic loss to prevent from unstable training. Finally, we propose a general EWC-based incremental object detection framework and implement it under both Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, showing its flexibility and versatility. In terms of either the final performance or the performance drop with respect to the upper bound of joint training on all seen classes, evaluations on the PASCAL VOC and COCO data sets show that our method achieves a new state of the art.},

Firstly, a memory knowledge graph (MKG) is generated to fully characterize the structural knowledge of historical tasks.

abstract = {This paper further investigates axiomatic characterizations of lower fuzzy rough approximation operators determined by a semicontinuous fuzzy implication I. The I-lower fuzzy rough approximation operators on a general fuzzy relation can be characterized by only one axiom. The axiomatic characterizations of I-lower fuzzy rough approximation operators are studied in two approaches, which characterize abstract I-lower fuzzy rough approximation operators with ordinary fuzzy operations on fuzzy sets and product operation, respectively. Considering the properties of fuzzy implications, different axioms are proposed for I-lower fuzzy rough approximation operators, which are determined by an S-implication, an R-implication and a fuzzy implication satisfying left neutrality property and regular property, respectively. When the fuzzy relation is special, such as serial, reflexive, symmetric and so on, I-lower fuzzy rough approximation operators can also be characterized by a single axiom.},

The current study is an exploration of the relationship between cosmetics, their match to certain situations, and the resulting anxiety levels. Anxiety was used as a measure of confidence. Participants altered their makeup in three different styles in two actual situations. After each situation, the participants filled out a short survey about their feelings about the makeup and the situation they were in. The Spielberger state-trait anxiety survey was used to gauge anxiety. It was thought that less anxiety would be felt when makeup matched the situation. Implications for the findings are discussed.},

Decreased droplet size and lipid polarity were observed after transesterification with alcohol in microalgae cells. Such decrease was beneficial in extracting lipid from microalgae with apolar hexane. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, and alcohol volume on microwave-assisted transesterification with ethanol and isopropanol were investigated, and results were compared with those with methanol. Microwave-assisted transesterification with ethanol and isopropanol, which were more miscible with lipid in cells, resulted in higher fatty acid alkyl ester (FAAE) yields than that with methanol when the reaction temperature was lower than 90 Â°C. The ethanol and isopropanol volumes in the transesterification with 95% FAAE yield were only 75% of the methanol volume. The crystallization temperatures (0.19 Â°C and -3.15 Â°C) of biodiesels produced from wet microalgae through lipid transesterification in cells with ethanol and isopropanol were lower than that with methanol (2.08 Â°C), which was favorable for biodiesel flow in cold districts and winter.},

In this article, we propose a tracker inspired by the cognitive psychological memory mechanism, which decomposes the tracking task into sensory memory register, short-term memory tracker, and long-term memory tracker like humans. The sensory memory register captures information with three-dimensional perception; the short-term memory tracker builds the highly plastic observation model via memory rehearsal; the long-term memory tracker builds the highly stable observation model via memory encoding and retrieval. With the cooperative models, the tracker can easily handle various tracking scenarios. In addition, an appearance-shape learning method is proposed to update the two-dimensional appearance model and three-dimensional shape model appropriately. Extensive experimental results on a large-scale benchmark data set demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art two-dimensional and three-dimensional trackers in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.},

abstract = {We discuss a general formulation for the Continual Learning (CL) problem for classification-a learning task where a stream provides samples to a learner and the goal of the learner, depending on the samples it receives, is to continually upgrade its knowledge about the old classes and learn new ones. Our formulation takes inspiration from the open-set recognition problem where test scenarios do not necessarily belong to the training distribution. We also discuss various quirks and assumptions encoded in recently proposed approaches for CL. We argue that some oversimplify the problem to an extent that leaves it with very little practical importance, and makes it extremely easy to perform well on. To validate this, we propose GDumb that (1) greedily stores samples in memory as they come and; (2) at test time, trains a model from scratch using samples only in the memory. We show that even though GDumb is not specifically designed for CL problems, it obtains state-of-the-art accuracies (often with large margins) in almost all the experiments when compared to a multitude of recently proposed algorithms. Surprisingly, it outperforms approaches in CL formulations for which they were specifically designed. This, we believe, raises concerns regarding our progress in CL for classification. Overall, we hope our formulation, characterizations and discussions will help in designing realistically useful CL algorithms, and GDumb will serve as a strong contender for the same.},

abstract = {Images are uploaded to the Internet over time which makes concept drifting and distribution change in semantic classes unavoidable. Current hashing methods being trained using a given static database may not be suitable for nonstationary semantic image retrieval problems. Moreover, directly retraining a whole hash table to update knowledge coming from new arriving image data may not be efficient. Therefore, this paper proposes a new incremental hash-bit learning method. At the arrival of new data, hash bits are selected from both existing and newly trained hash bits by an iterative maximization of a 3-component objective function. This objective function is also used to weight selected hash bits to re-rank retrieved images for better semantic image retrieval results. The three components evaluate a hash bit in three different angles: 1) information preservation; 2) partition balancing; and 3) bit angular difference. The proposed method combines knowledge retained from previously trained hash bits and new semantic knowledge learned from the new data by training new hash bits. In comparison to table-based incremental hashing, the proposed method automatically adjusts the number of bits from old data and new data according to the concept drifting in the given data via the maximization of the objective function. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing stationary hashing methods, table-based incremental hashing, and online hashing methods in 15 different simulated nonstationary data environments.},

This article reviews the infrared spectroscopy-based analytical methods that have been developed for consideration in clinical assays, including serum analysis, urine analysis, amniotic fluid assays for the estimation of fetal lung maturity, and others. Because of the widespread interest in the potential for in vivo measurement of blood glucose using near infrared spectroscopy, a separate section is devoted to the analysis of glucose in whole blood. A related technique uses the infrared spectrum of biomedical specimens directly as a diagnostic tool. For example, the spectra of serum and synovial fluid have proven to be useful in the diagnosis of metabolic disorders and arthritis, respectively, without explicitly recovering their chemical composition from the spectra. Rather, characteristic spectral features and patterns have been identified as the basis to distinguish spectra corresponding to healthy patients from those corresponding to diseased patients. These applications are reviewed here. Issues such as ease of use, speed, reliability, sample size, and calibration stability all play important roles in governing the practical acceptability of infrared spectroscopy-based analytical methods. To provide a framework to illustrate these issues, descriptions are included for the various procedures that have been explored to wed spectroscopy to clinical chemistry.},

@article{Mundt2020,
abstract = {Current deep learning research is dominated by benchmark evaluation. A method is regarded as favorable if it empirically performs well on the dedicated test set. This mentality is seamlessly reflected in the resurfacing area of continual learning, where consecutively arriving sets of benchmark data are investigated. The core challenge is framed as protecting previously acquired representations from being catastrophically forgotten due to the iterative parameter updates. However, comparison of individual methods is nevertheless treated in isolation from real world application and typically judged by monitoring accumulated test set performance. The closed world assumption remains predominant. It is assumed that during deployment a model is guaranteed to encounter data that stems from the same distribution as used for training. This poses a massive challenge as neural networks are well known to provide overconfident false predictions on unknown instances and break down in the face of corrupted data. In this work we argue that notable lessons from open set recognition, the identification of statistically deviating data outside of the observed dataset, and the adjacent field of active learning, where data is incrementally queried such that the expected performance gain is maximized, are frequently overlooked in the deep learning era. Based on these forgotten lessons, we propose a consolidated view to bridge continual learning, active learning and open set recognition in deep neural networks. Our results show that this not only benefits each individual paradigm, but highlights the natural synergies in a common framework. We empirically demonstrate improvements when alleviating catastrophic forgetting, querying data in active learning, selecting task orders, while exhibiting robust open world application where previously proposed methods fail.},

In this work, tests on a validated CFD model, which simulates the air flow inside a standard building, were carried out in order to obtain a suitable tool to predict ventilation performance and therefore optimize the building ventilation design. The model solves the mass, momentum and energy for the air flow, coupled with the k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model. The equations are solved by a FV discretization technique in a structured grid. Appropriated boundary conditions and the dimension of the domain were studied for more accuracy in numeric simulation. The influence of the free stream velocity profile and wind direction upon the efficiency of a natural ventilation system under isothermal conditions has been tested. The results obtained so far confirm the validity of the implemented model and its possible use for the optimal design of natural ventilation systems.},

Additionally, we extend two common methods, focusing on parameter and activation regularization, from the conventional single-classifier paradigm to MUC. Our classifier ensemble promotes regularizing network parameters or activations when moving to learn the next task. Under the setting of task-agnostic evaluation, our experimental results on CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet incremental benchmarks show that our method outperforms other baselines.

abstract = {An increasingly large percentage of power is being generated from renewable energy sources with intermittent and fluctuating outputs. Therefore there is a growing need for energy storage. With power-to-gas, excess electricity is converted into hydrogen by water electrolysis, which can be stored and, when needed, can be reconverted into electricity with fuel cells. Besides the energy vector for electricity, mobility and heat, hydrogen can be utilized as a raw material for the chemical industry or further be used for the synthesis of various hydrocarbon fuels such as methane. This article is an international review of numerous power-to-gas pilot plants that have either already been realized or are being planned. It provides information about their installed components and capacities as well as about operating experience that has been had with them. In many of the projects it was concluded that the design and sizing, control strategy and system integration of the power-to-gas plants have a great influence on their overall efficiency, reliability and economics. Topics for further research are the improvement of the efficiency, reliability, lifetime and costs of electrolyzers and fuel cells and better ways of dealing with power sources. In order to improve the overall performance, the reduction of auxiliary equipment and the continuous long-term operation of power-to-gas pilot plants will be necessary. The further development of codes and standards for permits to operate, as well as of hydrogen components and control strategies, would bring additional benefits for power-to-gas systems. It is also recommended that optimum system configurations and components be determined with regard to the available infrastructure and the type of application involved.

abstract = {Most standard learning approaches lead to fragile models which are prone to drift when sequentially trained on samples of a different nature - the well-known "catastrophic forgetting" issue. In particular, when a model consecutively learns from different visual domains, it tends to forget the past ones in favor of the most recent. In this context, we show that one way to learn models that are inherently more robust against forgetting is domain randomization - for vision tasks, randomizing the current domain's distribution with heavy image manipulations. Building on this result, we devise a meta-learning strategy where a regularizer explicitly penalizes any loss associated with transferring the model from the current domain to different "auxiliary" meta-domains, while also easing adaptation to them. Such meta-domains, are also generated through randomized image manipulations. We empirically demonstrate in a variety of experiments - spanning from classification to semantic segmentation - that our approach results in models that are less prone to catastrophic forgetting when transferred to new domains.},

abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated by splitting data from a single source into training and test sets. While such focus on in-distribution learning scenarios has led interesting advances, it has not been able to tell if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for successful prediction (e.g., using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles). Such biased models fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a different class. The cross-bias generalisation problem has been addressed by de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of a snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a de-biased representation by encouraging it to be different from a set of representations that are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many scenarios where it is much easier to define a set of biased representations than to define and quantify bias. Our experiments and analyses show that our method discourages models from taking bias shortcuts, resulting in improved performances on de-biased test data.},

Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been identified as an effective tool for building performance analysis virtually in the design stage. The main aims of this study were to assess various combinations of materials using BIM and identify alternative, sustainable solutions to reduce operational energy consumption. The amount of energy consumed by a double story bungalow house in Johor, Malaysia, and assessments of alternative material configurations to determine the best energy performance were evaluated by using Revit Architecture 2012 and Autodesk Ecotect Analysis software to show which of the materials helped in reducing the operational energy use of the building to the greatest extent throughout its annual life cycle. At the end, some alternative, sustainable designs in terms of energy savings have been suggested.},

We reveal an unexpected connection between this new loss and the Huber classification loss. We obtain promising empirical results in multi-label classification problems and in attention-based neural networks for natural language inference. For the latter, we achieve a similar performance as the traditional softmax, but with a selective, more compact, attention focus.},

abstract = {Few-shot learning is challenging due to its very limited data and labels. Recent studies in big transfer (BiT) show that few-shot learning can greatly benefit from pretraining on large scale labeled dataset in a different domain. This paper asks a more challenging question: "can we use as few as possible labels for few-shot learning in both pretraining (with no labels) and fine-tuning (with fewer labels)?". Our key insight is that the clustering of target samples in the feature space is all we need for few-shot finetuning. It explains why the vanilla unsupervised pretraining (poor clustering) is worse than the supervised one. In this paper, we propose transductive unsupervised pretraining that achieves a better clustering by involving target data even though its amount is very limited. The improved clustering result is of great value for identifying the most representative samples ("eigen-samples") for users to label, and in return, continued finetuning with the labeled eigen-samples further improves the clustering. Thus, we propose eigen-finetuning to enable fewer shot learning by leveraging the co-evolution of clustering and eigen-samples in the finetuning. We conduct experiments on 10 different few-shot target datasets, and our average few-shot performance outperforms both vanilla inductive unsupervised transfer and supervised transfer by a large margin. For instance, when each target category only has 10 labeled samples, the mean accuracy gain over the above two baselines is 9.2% and 3.42 respectively.},

abstract = {Long-term visual tracking is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision and is closer to practical application needs. In long-term video sequences, tracking targets often undergo dramatic appearance changes over time due to various factors such as scale variation, illumination change, occlusions and so on. In this work, we propose a novel robust long-term tracking framework based on continual learning and dynamic sample set modules. We transform the online tracking process into a continual learning process of the target model, and continuously learn various appearance changes to adapt to different scenarios. The continual learning module distills the beneficial knowledge of the old network to the new network through warm-up and joint training to achieve a comprehensive and holistic memory of the target appearance. Combining the dynamic sample set can effectively balance the short-term memory and long-term memory of the model, and establish a near-complete target appearance description in the long-term dimension to cope with various challenging situations. Experimental results on the large-scale long-term benchmark datasets LaSOT and UAV20L show that the proposed method performs favourably against other state-of-the-art trackers.},

Generally, QPPC structures exhibit both aperiodicity and multiple PBGs due to their long-range order. They are described by a simple analytical expression, instead of quasiperiodic tiling approaches based on substitution rules. Here we describe the optical properties of QPPCs exhibiting two PBGs that can be tuned independently. PBG interband spacing and its depth can be varied by choosing appropriate reciprocal lattice vectors and their amplitudes. These effects are confirmed by the proof-of-concept measurements made for the porous silicon-based QPPC of the appropriate design.},

abstract = {Pooling operators are key components in most Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as they serve to downsample images, aggregate feature information, and increase receptive field. However, standard pooling operators reduce the feature size gradually to avoid significant loss in information via gross aggregation. Consequently, CNN architectures tend to be deep, computationally expensive and challenging to deploy on RAM constrained devices. We introduce RNNPool, a novel pooling operator based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), that efficiently aggregate features over large patches of an image and rapidly downsamples its size. Our empirical evaluation indicates that an RNNPool layer(s) can effectively replace multiple blocks in a variety of architectures such as MobileNets (Sandler et al., 2018), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) and can be used for several vision tasks like image classification and face detection. That is, RNNPool can significantly decrease computational complexity and peak RAM usage for inference while retaining comparable accuracy. Further, we use RNNPool to construct a novel real-time face detection method that achieves state-of-the-art MAP within computational budget afforded by a tiny Cortex M4 microcontroller with - 256 KB RAM.},

abstract = {Regular durability testing of heavy duty fuel cell systems for transit bus application requires several thousand hours of operation, which is costly and time consuming. Alternatively, accelerated durability tests are able to generate failure modes observed in field operation in a compressed time period, by applying enhanced levels of stress. The objective of the present work is to design and validate an accelerated membrane durability test (AMDT) for heavy duty fuel cells under bus related conditions. The proposed AMDTgenerates bus relevant membrane failure modes in a fewhundred hours, which is more than an order ofmagnitude faster than for regular duty cycle testing. Elevated voltage, temperature, and oxidant levels are used to accelerate membrane chemical stress, while relative humidity (RH) cycling is used to induce mechanical stress. RH cycling is found to significantly reduce membrane life-time compared to constant RH conditions. The role of a platinum band in the membrane is investigated and membranes with Pt bands demonstrate a considerable life-time extension under AMDT conditions, with minimal membrane degradation. Overall, this research serves to establish a benchmark AMDT that can rapidly and reliably evaluate membrane stability under simulated heavy duty fuel cell conditions.},

abstract = {To reduce the significant redundancy in deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), most existing methods prune neurons by only considering the statistics of an individual layer or two consecutive layers (e.g., prune one layer to minimize the reconstruction error of the next layer), ignoring the effect of error propagation in deep networks. In contrast, we argue that for a pruned network to retain its predictive power, it is essential to prune neurons in the entire neuron network jointly based on a unified goal: Minimizing the reconstruction error of important responses in the 'final response layer' (FRL), which is the second-to-last layer before classification. Specifically, we apply feature ranking techniques to measure the importance of each neuron in the FRL, formulate network pruning as a binary integer optimization problem, and derive a closed-form solution to it for pruning neurons in earlier layers. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose the Neuron Importance Score Propagation (NISP) algorithm to propagate the importance scores of final responses to every neuron in the network. The CNN is pruned by removing neurons with least importance, and it is then fine-tuned to recover its predictive power. NISP is evaluated on several datasets with multiple CNN models and demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration and compression with negligible accuracy loss.},

abstract = {PURPOSE This study evaluated pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging (DOSI) biomarkers in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). MATERIALS AND METHODS The institution's ethics review board approved this study. Subjects (n = 22) gave written informed consent prior to participating. US and DOSI data were acquired, relative to the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8 and preoperatively. QUS parameters including the mid-band fit (MBF), 0-MHz intercept (SI), and the spectral slope (SS) were determined from tumor ultrasound data using spectral analysis. In the same patients, DOSI was used to measure parameters relating to tumor hemoglobin and composition. Discriminant analysis and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to classify clinical and pathological response during treatment and to estimate the area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, multivariate analysis was carried out for pairwise QUS/DOSI parameter combinations using a logistic regression model. RESULTS Individual QUS and DOSI parameters, including the (SI), oxy-hemoglobin (HbO2), and total hemoglobin (HbT) were significant markers for response after one week of treatment (p < 0.01). Multivariate (pairwise) combinations increased the sensitivity, specificity and AUC at this time; the SI + HbO2 showed a sensitivity/specificity of 100%, and an AUC of 1.0. CONCLUSIONS QUS and DOSI demonstrated potential as coincident markers for treatment response and may potentially facilitate response-guided therapies. Multivariate QUS and DOSI parameters increased the sensitivity and specificity of classifying LABC patients as early as one week after treatment.},

Given only a large, unlabeled image collection, we extract random pairs of patches from each image and train a convolutional neural net to predict the position of the second patch relative to the first. We argue that doing well on this task requires the model to learn to recognize objects and their parts. We demonstrate that the feature representation learned using this within-image context indeed captures visual similarity across images. For example, this representation allows us to perform unsupervised visual discovery of objects like cats, people, and even birds from the Pascal VOC 2011 detection dataset. Furthermore, we show that the learned ConvNet can be used in the R-CNN framework [19] and provides a significant boost over a randomly-initialized ConvNet, resulting in state-of-the-art performance among algorithms which use only Pascal-provided training set annotations.},

abstract = {Wave forecasting may represent a useful tool for safety assessment of maritime works and activities. To date, wave forecasting uncertainty is usually corrected by using either the mean calibration factor or the time series method. However, within the frame of maritime work management it is necessary to forecast â with an acceptable probability of error â whether or not the significant wave height at a given location will exceed a prefixed threshold within a specified temporal window, so as to assess the safety of the specified temporal window with respect to the activity to be carried out. The present paper aims to illustrate a general criterion useful to correct wave forecast, i.e. to provide an engineering tool able to assess the safety of the temporal window needed to complete a specified maritime work. The paper provides a detailed description of the method, together with the application to a real case.},

abstract = {Unsupervised Domain Adaptation solves knowledge transfer along with the coexistence of well-annotated source domain and unlabeled target instances. However, the source domain in many practical applications is not always accessible due to data privacy or the insufficient memory storage for small devices. This scenario defined as Source-free Domain Adaptation only allows accessing the well-trained source model for target learning. To address the challenge of source data unavailability, we develop an Adaptive Adversarial Network (A 2 Net) including three components. Specifically, the first one named Adaptive Ad-versarial Inference seeks a target-specific classifier to advance the recognition of samples which the provided source-specific classifier difficultly identifies. Then, the Contrastive Category-wise Matching module exploits the positive relation of every two target images to enforce the compactness of subspace for each category. Thirdly, Self-Supervised Rotation facilitates the model to learn additional semantics from target images by themselves. Extensive experiments on the popular cross-domain benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed model on solving adaptation task without any source data.},

abstract = {At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit (12; 9), thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function f$\theta$ (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.r.t. a new kernel: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We then focus on the setting of least-squares regression and show that in the infinite-width limit, the network function f$\theta$ follows a linear differential equation during training. The convergence is fastest along the largest kernel principal components of the input data with respect to the NTK, hence suggesting a theoretical motivation for early stopping. Finally we study the NTK numerically, observe its behavior for wide networks, and compare it to the infinite-width limit.},

abstract = {Studies in biological vision have always been a great source of inspiration for design of computer vision algorithms. In the past, several successful methods were designed with varying degrees of correspondence with biological vision studies, ranging from purely functional inspiration to methods that utilise models that were primarily developed for explaining biological observations. Even though it seems well recognised that computational models of biological vision can help in design of computer vision algorithms, it is a non-trivial exercise for a computer vision researcher to mine relevant information from biological vision literature as very few studies in biology are organised at a task level. In this paper we aim to bridge this gap by providing a computer vision task centric presentation of models primarily originating in biological vision studies. Not only do we revisit some of the main features of biological vision and discuss the foundations of existing computational studies modelling biological vision, but also we consider three classical computer vision tasks from a biological perspective: image sensing, segmentation and optical flow. Using this task-centric approach, we discuss well-known biological functional principles and compare them with approaches taken by computer vision. Based on this comparative analysis of computer and biological vision, we present some recent models in biological vision and highlight a few models that we think are promising for future investigations in computer vision. To this extent, this paper provides new insights and a starting point for investigators interested in the design of biology-based computer vision algorithms and pave a way for much needed interaction between the two communities leading to the development of synergistic models of artificial and biological vision.},

abstract = {Continual learning of deep neural networks is a key requirement for scaling them up to more complex applicative scenarios and for achieving real lifelong learning of these architectures. Previous approaches to the problem have considered either the progressive increase in the size of the networks, or have tried to regularize the network behavior to equalize it with respect to previously observed tasks. In the latter case, it is essential to understand what type of information best represents this past behavior. Common techniques include regularizing the past outputs, gradients, or individual weights. In this work, we propose a new, relatively simple and efficient method to perform continual learning by regularizing instead the network internal embeddings. To make the approach scalable, we also propose a dynamic sampling strategy to reduce the memory footprint of the required external storage. We show that our method performs favorably with respect to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, while requiring significantly less space in memory and computational time. In addition, inspired by to recent works, we evaluate the impact of selecting a more flexible model for the activation functions inside the network, evaluating the impact of catastrophic forgetting on the activation functions themselves.},

When existing object detectors are applied to such scenarios, their performance on old classes deteriorates significantly. A few efforts have been reported to address this limitation, all of which apply variants of knowledge distillation to avoid catastrophic forgetting. We note that although distillation helps to retain previous learning, it obstructs fast adaptability to new tasks, which is a critical requirement for incremental learning. In this pursuit, we propose a meta-learning approach that learns to reshape model gradients, such that information across incremental tasks is optimally shared. This ensures a seamless information transfer via a meta-learned gradient preconditioning that minimizes forgetting and maximizes knowledge transfer. In comparison to existing meta-learning methods, our approach is task-agnostic, allows incremental addition of new-classes and scales to large-sized models for object detection. We evaluate our approach on a variety of incremental settings defined on PASCAL-VOC and MS COCO datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art.},

We establish global convergence properties of MFL and derive an upper bound on MFL convergence rate. Comparing the upper bounds on MFL and FL convergence rate, we provide conditions in which MFL accelerates the convergence. For different machine learning models, the convergence performance of MFL is evaluated based on experiments with MNIST dataset.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.},

abstract = {In this work, active vibration mitigation for smart single link manipulator is presented. Two piezoelectric transducers were utilized to act as actuator and sensor respectively. Classical Proportional (P) controller was tested numerically and experimentally. The comparison between measured results showed good agreement. The proposed work includes the introducing of fuzzy logic for tuning controller's gain within finite element method. Classical Proportional-Integral (PI), Fuzzy-P and Fuzzy-PI controllers were totally integrated as a series of [IF-Then] states and solved numerically by using Finite Element (FE) solver (ANSYS). Proposed method will pave the way on solving the tuning process totally within single FE solver with high efficiency. Proposed method satisfied mitigation in the overall free response with about 52% and 74% of the manipulator settling time when Fuzzy-P and Fuzzy-PI controllers were activated respectively. This contribution can be utilized for many other applications related to fuzzy topics.},

First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.},

abstract = {Neuro-fuzzy systems have been proved to be an efficient tool for modelling real life systems. They are precise and have ability to generalise knowledge from presented data. Neuro-fuzzy systems use fuzzy sets â most commonly type-1 fuzzy sets. Type-2 fuzzy sets model uncertainties better than type-1 fuzzy sets because of their fuzzy membership function. Unfortunately computational complexity of type reduction in general type-2 systems is high enough to hinder their practical application. This burden can be alleviated by application of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The paper presents an interval type-2 neuro-fuzzy system with interval type-2 fuzzy sets both in premises (Gaussian interval type-2 fuzzy sets with uncertain fuzziness) and consequences (trapezoid interval type-2 fuzzy set). The inference mechanism is based on the interval type-2 fuzzy {\L}ukasiewicz, Reichenbach, Kleene-Dienes, or BrouwerâG{\"{o}}del implications. The paper is accompanied by numerical examples. The system can elaborate models with lower error rate than type-1 neuro-fuzzy system with implication-based inference mechanism. The system outperforms some known type-2 neuro-fuzzy systems.},

abstract = {Lifelong learning is challenging for deep neural networks due to their susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting occurs when a trained network is not able to maintain its ability to accomplish previously learned tasks when it is trained to perform new tasks. We study the problem of lifelong learning for generative models, extending a trained network to new conditional generation tasks without forgetting previous tasks, while assuming access to the training data for the current task only. In contrast to state-of-the-art memory replay based approaches which are limited to label-conditioned image generation tasks, a more generic framework for continual learning of generative models under different conditional image generation settings is proposed in this paper. Lifelong GAN employs knowledge distillation to transfer learned knowledge from previous networks to the new network. This makes it possible to perform image-conditioned generation tasks in a lifelong learning setting. We validate Lifelong GAN for both image-conditioned and label-conditioned generation tasks, and provide qualitative and quantitative results to show the generality and effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks are used in many state-of-the-art systems for machine perception. Once a network is trained to do a specific task, e.g., bird classification, it cannot easily be trained to do new tasks, e.g., incrementally learning to recognize additional bird species or learning an entirely different task such as flower recognition. When new tasks are added, typical deep neural networks are prone to catastrophically forgetting previous tasks. Networks that are capable of assimilating new information incrementally, much like how humans form new memories over time, will be more efficient than retraining the model from scratch each time a new task needs to be learned. There have been multiple attempts to develop schemes that mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but these methods have not been directly compared, the tests used to evaluate them vary considerably, and these methods have only been evaluated on small-scale problems (e.g., MNIST). In this paper, we introduce new metrics and benchmarks for directly comparing five different mechanisms designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in neural networks: regularization, ensembling, rehearsal, dual-memory, and sparse-coding. Our experiments on real-world images and sounds show that the mechanism(s) that are critical for optimal performance vary based on the incremental training paradigm and type of data being used, but they all demonstrate that the catastrophic forgetting problem is not yet solved.},

A cooling system has been developed based on water spraying of PV panels. A mathematical model has been used to determine when to start cooling of the PV panels as the temperature of the panels reaches the maximum allowable temperature (MAT). A cooling model has been developed to determine how long it takes to cool down the PV panels to its normal operating temperature, i.e., 35 C, based on the proposed cooling system. Both models, the heating rate model and the cooling rate model, are validated experimentally. Based on the heating and cooling rate models, it is found that the PV panels yield the highest output energy if cooling of the panels starts when the temperature of the PV panels reaches a maximum allowable temperature (MAT) of 45 C. The MAT is a compromise temperature between the output energy from the PV panels and the energy needed for cooling. {\textcopyright} 2013 Ain Shams University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {For object detection, the two-stage approach (e.g., Faster R-CNN) has been achieving the highest accuracy, whereas the one-stage approach (e.g., SSD) has the advantage of high efficiency. To inherit the merits of both while overcoming their disadvantages, in this paper, we propose a novel single-shot based detector, called RefineDet, that achieves better accuracy than two-stage methods and maintains comparable efficiency of one-stage methods. RefineDet consists of two inter-connected modules, namely, the anchor refinement module and the object detection module. Specifically, the former aims to (1) filter out negative anchors to reduce search space for the classifier, and (2) coarsely adjust the locations and sizes of anchors to provide better initialization for the subsequent regressor. The latter module takes the refined anchors as the input from the former to further improve the regression and predict multi-class label. Meanwhile, we design a transfer connection block to transfer the features in the anchor refinement module to predict locations, sizes and class labels of objects in the object detection module. The multi-task loss function enables us to train the whole network in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, and MS COCO demonstrate that RefineDet achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high efficiency.

abstract = {Image restoration algorithms often require previous knowledge about the point spread function (PSF) of the disturbance. Deriving the PSF manually from a degraded ideal step-edge in the image is a well known procedure intended mainly for isotropic degradations. A common image degradation that can be approximated as isotropic is the atmospheric blurring in long-distance imaging. This paper proposes an efficient method that automatically finds the best (closest to ideal) step-edge from the degraded image. The identified PSF is then used to restore the image. The existence of a good step-edge in the image may be assumed in cases such as imaging of urban areas, which is common in applications such as visual surveillance and reconnaissance. The criteria employed include the straightness and length of the edge, its strength, and the homogeneity of the step. An efficient algorithm is proposed, and results of automatic blind image restoration based on the automatically extracted PSF are shown. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks, assisted by architectural design strategies, make extensive use of data augmentation techniques and layers with a high number of feature maps to embed object transformations. That is highly inefficient and for large datasets implies a massive redundancy of features detectors. Even though capsules networks are still in their infancy, they constitute a promising solution to extend current convolutional networks and endow artificial visual perception with a process to encode more efficiently all feature affine transformations. Indeed, a properly working capsule network should theoretically achieve higher results with a considerably lower number of parameters count due to intrinsic capability to generalize to novel viewpoints. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to this relevant aspect. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of capsule networks and, pushing their capacity to the limits with an extreme architecture with barely 160K parameters, we prove that the proposed architecture is still able to achieve state-of-the-art results on three different datasets with only 2% of the original CapsNet parameters. Moreover, we replace dynamic routing with a novel non-iterative, highly parallelizable routing algorithm that can easily cope with a reduced number of capsules. Extensive experimentation with other capsule implementations has proved the effectiveness of our methodology and the capability of capsule networks to efficiently embed visual representations more prone to generalization.},

abstract = {Context: Millions of individuals habitually expose themselves to room light in the hours before bedtime, yet the effects of this behavior on melatonin signaling are not well recognized. Objective:Wetested the hypothesis that exposure toroomlight in the late evening suppresses the onset of melatonin synthesis and shortens the duration of melatonin production. Design: In a retrospective analysis, we compared daily melatonin profiles in individuals living in room light (?200 lux) vs. dim light (?3 lux). Patients: Healthy volunteers (n ? 116, 18â30 yr) were recruited from the general population to participate in one of two studies. Setting: Participants lived in a General Clinical Research Center for at least five consecutive days. Intervention: Individuals were exposed to room light or dim light in the 8 h preceding bedtime. Outcome Measures: Melatonin duration, onset and offset, suppression, and phase angle of en- trainment were determined. Results: Compared with dim light, exposure to room light before bedtime suppressed melatonin, resulting in a later melatonin onset in 99.0% of individuals and shortening melatonin duration by about 90 min. Also, exposure to room light during the usual hours of sleep suppressed melatonin by greater than 50% in most (85%) trials. Conclusions:Thesefindingsindicatethatroomlightexertsaprofoundsuppressiveeffectonmelatonin levels and shortens the body's internal representation of night duration. Hence, chronically exposing oneself to electrical lighting in the late evening disrupts melatonin signaling and could therefore potentially impact sleep, thermoregulation, blood pressure, and glucose homeostasis.},

abstract = {The weather natural disaster prevention for quantitative daily rainfall forecasting derived from the SACZ-ULCV weather pattern is proposed in this paper by using intertwined statistical downscaling (SD) and soft computing (SC) approaches. The fuzzy statistical downscaling (FSD) is first introduced and, then, employed for dealing with the SACZ-ULCV atmospheric circulation-type specific weather pattern for supporting daily precipitation (rainfall) forecasting. This paper also addresses the performance comparison of the FSD and the neural statistical downscaling (NSD) approaches when taking into account 12 major urban centers all over the state of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil, for the summer period. The SACZ-ULCV summer pattern is identified in meteorological satellite images when the cloudiness of the Brazilian Northeast upper level cyclonic vortices (ULCV) meets the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ). Increasing the convection and the cloudiness over the Southeast region of Brazil, the SACZ-ULCV causes severe rainfalls and thunderstorms with impact on the population. Finding a manner to anticipate these extreme rainfall events is of vital importance for minimizing or avoiding disasters, and saving lives. Daily rainfall forecasting had their performance improved either by using the proposed FSD or NSD in comparison to the Multilinear Regression ETA model. Results demonstrate the FSD and the NSD become feasible alternatives for achieving a correspondence from meteorological and thermo-dynamical variables to the daily rainfall variable. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Adequate water management represents one of the main challenges in the design and operation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. In this work, the influence of inlet gas humidification on cell performance is investigated by in-situ current density measurements obtained using the segmented cell approach. Particular attention is paid to the combined effect of cell temperature and relative humidity of the anode and cathode feed streams. When operated at 80 â¢ C and low humidity conditions, the cell is seen to undergo a severe voltage decline that is not observed at 60 â¢ C. The analysis shows that the variation with temperature of the water uptake rate of the gaseous streams plays a key role in determining the observed differences in performance stability. In the case of 60 â¢ C operation, the water uptake rate of the cathode stream at 50% inlet relative humidity is roughly 30% of its value at 80 â¢ C at the same humidification level, resulting in a significantly lower drying capacity. A simple balance of water model, able to explain the observed cell behavior, is finally presented and discussed. Energy demand has become one of the most serious concerns of modern society due to the problems related with greenhouse gas emis-sions and the depletion of fossil fuels. In this context, hydrogen is ex-pected to play an important role as future energy vector, with polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) being the leading candi-dates to provide efficient and clean electric energy conversion during the XXI century. Recently, significant progress has been made toward meeting the challenging cost and performance targets required for the widespread use of PEMFCs, specifically in the automotive industry.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks have been widely deployed in various application scenarios. In order to extend the applications' boundaries to some accuracy-crucial domains, researchers have been investigating approaches to boost accuracy through either deeper or wider network structures, which brings with them the exponential increment of the computational and storage cost, delaying the responding time. In this paper, we propose a general training framework named self distillation, which notably enhances the performance (accuracy) of convolutional neural networks through shrinking the size of the network rather than aggrandizing it. Different from traditional knowledge distillation - a knowledge transformation methodology among networks, which forces student neural networks to approximate the softmax layer outputs of pre-trained teacher neural networks, the proposed self distillation framework distills knowledge within network itself. The networks are firstly divided into several sections. Then the knowledge in the deeper portion of the networks is squeezed into the shallow ones. Experiments further prove the generalization of the proposed self distillation framework: Enhancement of accuracy at average level is 2.65%, varying from 0.61% in ResNeXt as minimum to 4.07% in VGG19 as maximum. In addition, it can also provide flexibility of depth-wise scalable inference on resource-limited edge devices. Our codes have been released on github.},

abstract = {We introduce and study the problem of Online Continual Compression, where one attempts to simultaneously learn to compress and store a representative dataset from a non i.i.d data stream, while only observing each sample once. A naive application of auto-encoders in this setting encounters a major challenge: representations derived from earlier encoder states must be usable by later decoder states. We show how to use discrete auto-encoders to effectively address this challenge and introduce Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) to control variation in the compression ability of the module at any given stage of learning. This enables selecting an appropriate compression for incoming samples, while taking into account overall memory constraints and current progress of the learned compression. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require any pretraining, even on challenging datasets. We show that using AQM to replace standard episodic memory in continual learning settings leads to significant gains on continual learning benchmarks. Furthermore we demonstrate this approach with larger images, LiDAR, and reinforcement learning environments.},

The accuracy of forecasted solar radiation will affect the power output forecast of grid-connected photovoltaic systems which is important for power system operation and planning. The future sky conditions and temperature information is obtained from National Environment Agency (NEA) and the sky and temperature information will be classified as different fuzzy sets based on fuzzy rules. By using fuzzy logic and neural network together, the forecast results can follow the real values very well under different sky and temperature conditions. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by a case study where four different scenarios are tested.

abstract = {For manufacturers, forecasting the future yield of a product is a critical task. However, a yield learning process involves considerable uncertainty, rendering the task difficult. Although a few fuzzy collaborative intelligence (FCI) methods have been proposed in recent years, they are not problem-free. Hence, to overcome the challenges associated with these methods and to improve the accuracy of future yield forecasts, a heterogeneous FCI approach is proposed in this study. In this method, an expert applies mathematical-programming-based or artificial-neural-network-based methods (i.e., heterogeneous methods) to model an uncertain yield learning process. Subsequently, fuzzy intersection narrows the possible range of the future yield, and finally, an artificial neural network derives a crisp (representative) value. The effectiveness of the proposed heterogeneous FCI approach was successfully demonstrated by considering data obtained from a factory manufacturing dynamic random access memory devices. The approach achieved an average increase of 21% in the forecasting accuracy compared with existing approaches.},

Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.},

abstract = {Open set recognition requires a classifier to detect samples not belonging to any of the classes in its training set. Existing methods fit a probability distribution to the training samples on their embedding space and detect outliers according to this distribution. The embedding space is often obtained from a discriminative classifier. However, such discriminative representation focuses only on known classes, which may not be critical for distinguishing the unknown classes. We argue that the representation space should be jointly learned from the inlier classifier and the density estimator (served as an outlier detector). We propose the OpenHybrid framework, which is composed of an encoder to encode the input data into a joint embedding space, a classifier to classify samples to inlier classes, and a flow-based density estimator to detect whether a sample belongs to the unknown category. A typical problem of existing flow-based models is that they may assign a higher likelihood to outliers. However, we empirically observe that such an issue does not occur in our experiments when learning a joint representation for discriminative and generative components. Experiments on standard open set benchmarks also reveal that an end-to-end trained OpenHybrid model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and flow-based baselines.},

However, the majority of biologically-plausible learning algorithms have not yet reached the performance of backpropagation (BP), nor are they built on strong theoretical foundations. Here, we analyze target propagation (TP), a popular but not yet fully understood alternative to BP, from the standpoint of mathematical optimization. Our theory shows that TP is closely related to Gauss-Newton optimization and thus substantially differs from BP. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of difference target propagation (DTP), a well-known variant of TP, in the realistic scenario of non-invertible neural networks. We provide a first solution to this problem through a novel reconstruction loss that improves feedback weight training, while simultaneously introducing architectural flexibility by allowing for direct feedback connections from the output to each hidden layer. Our theory is corroborated by experimental results that show significant improvements in performance and in the alignment of forward weight updates with loss gradients, compared to DTP.

Instead of filling in a single value for each missing value, Rubin's (1987) multiple imputation procedure replaces each missing value with a set of plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute. These multiply imputed data sets are then analyzed by using standard procedures for complete data and combining the results from these analyses. No matter which complete-data analysis is used, the process of combining results from different imputed data sets is essentially the same. This results in valid statistical inferences that properly reflect the uncertainty due to missing values. This paper reviews methods for analyzing missing data, including basic concepts and applications of multiple imputation techniques. The paper presents SAS{\textregistered} procedures, PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE, for creating multiple imputations for incomplete multivariate data and for analyzing results from multiply imputed data sets.},

Tabular data usually contains a mix of discrete and continuous columns. Continuous columns may have multiple modes whereas discrete columns are sometimes imbalanced making the modeling difficult. Existing statistical and deep neural network models fail to properly model this type of data. We design TGAN, which uses a conditional generative adversarial network to address these challenges. To aid in a fair and thorough comparison, we design a benchmark with 7 simulated and 8 real datasets and several Bayesian network baselines.

abstract = {There is an increasing need to bring machine learning to a wide diversity of hardware devices. Current frameworks rely on vendor-specific operator libraries and optimize for a narrow range of server-class GPUs. Deploying workloads to new platforms - such as mobile phones, embedded devices, and accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) - requires significant manual effort. We propose TVM, a compiler that exposes graph-level and operator-level optimizations to provide performance portability to deep learning workloads across diverse hardware back-ends. TVM solves optimization challenges specific to deep learning, such as high-level operator fusion, mapping to arbitrary hardware primitives, and memory latency hiding. It also automates optimization of low-level programs to hardware characteristics by employing a novel, learning-based cost modeling method for rapid exploration of code optimizations. Experimental results show that TVM delivers performance across hardware back-ends that are competitive with state-of-the-art, hand-tuned libraries for low-power CPU, mobile GPU, and server-class GPUs. We also demonstrate TVM's ability to target new accelerator back-ends, such as the FPGA-based generic deep learning accelerator. The system is open sourced and in production use inside several major companies.},

We keep the convolutional feature maps as the image embedding to preserve spatial structures and adopt Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to compute the similarity between two embeddings. Our Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN) baseline achieves 39.8% mAP on COCO, which is on par with the state of the art self-supervised methods pre-trained on ImageNet. More importantly, it can be further improved to 40.4% mAP with more unlabeled images, showing its great potential for leveraging more easily obtained unlabeled data. Code will be made available.},

abstract = {While energy-based models (EBMs) exhibit a number of desirable properties, training and sampling on high-dimensional datasets remains challenging. Inspired by recent progress on diffusion probabilistic models, we present a diffusion recovery likelihood method to tractably learn and sample from a sequence of EBMs trained on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset. Each EBM is trained by maximizing the recovery likelihood: the conditional probability of the data at a certain noise level given their noisy versions at a higher noise level. The recovery likelihood objective is more tractable than the marginal likelihood objective, since it only requires MCMC sampling from a relatively concentrated conditional distribution. Moreover, we show that this estimation method is theoretically consistent: it learns the correct conditional and marginal distributions at each noise level, given sufficient data. After training, synthesized images can be generated efficiently by a sampling process that initializes from a spherical Gaussian distribution and progressively samples the conditional distributions at decreasingly lower noise levels. Our method generates high fidelity samples on various image datasets. On unconditional CIFAR-10 our method achieves FID 9.60 and inception score 8.58, superior to the majority of GANs. Moreover, we demonstrate that unlike previous work on EBMs, our long-run MCMC samples from the conditional distributions do not diverge and still represent realistic images, allowing us to accurately estimate the normalized density of data even for high-dimensional datasets.},

abstract = {Traditional deep neural networks (NNs) have significantly contributed to the state-of-the-art performance in the task of classification under various application domains. However, NNs have not considered inherent uncertainty in data associated with the class probabilities where misclassification under uncertainty may easily introduce high risk in decision making in real-world contexts (e.g., misclassification of objects in roads leads to serious accidents). Unlike Bayesian NN that indirectly infer uncertainty through weight uncertainties, evidential NNs (ENNs) have been recently proposed to explicitly model the uncertainty of class probabilities and use them for classification tasks. An ENN offers the formulation of the predictions of NNs as subjective opinions and learns the function by collecting an amount of evidence that can form the subjective opinions by a deterministic NN from data. However, the ENN is trained as a black box without explicitly considering inherent uncertainty in data with their different root causes, such as vacuity (i.e., uncertainty due to a lack of evidence) or dissonance (i.e., uncertainty due to conflicting evidence). By considering the multidimensional uncertainty, we proposed a novel uncertainty-aware evidential NN called WGAN-ENN (WENN) for solving an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. We took a hybrid approach that combines Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with ENNs to jointly train a model with prior knowledge of a certain class, which has high vacuity for OOD samples. Via extensive empirical experiments based on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrated that the estimation of uncertainty by WENN can significantly help distinguish OOD samples from boundary samples. WENN outperformed in OOD detection when compared with other competitive counterparts.},

Not only because of its practical value in meteorology, but it is also a typical "unbiased" time series forecasting problem in scientific research. In this paper, we propose an innovative, intelligent multiagent-based environment, namely intelligent Java Agent Development Environment (iJADE), to provide an integrated and intelligent agent-based platform in the e-commerce environment. In addition to the facilities found in contemporary agent development platforms, which focus on the autonomy and mobility of the multiagents, iJADE provides an intelligent layer (known as the "conscious layer") to implement various AI functionalities in order to produce "smart" agents. From an implementation point of view, we introduce a weather forecasting system known as iJADE WeatherMAN - a weather forecasting system that uses fuzzy-neuro-based intelligent agents for automatic weather information gathering and filtering, and for time series weather prediction. Compared with the previous studies on single point sources using a similar network and other networks, such as the radial basis function network, learning vector quantization and the Na&iuml;ve Bayesian network, our experimental results are very promising. This neural-based rainfall forecasting system is useful and can be used in parallel with traditional forecast methods that are used at the Hong Kong Observatory.},

We also present an unifying open-world framework combining three individual research dimensions which have been explored independently \ie Incremental Learning, Out-of-Distribution detection and Open-World learning. We observe that the supervised feature representations are limited and degenerate for the Open-World setting and unsupervised feature representation is native to each of these three problem domains. Under an unsupervised feature representation, we categorize the problem of detecting unknowns as either Out-of-Label-space or Out-of-Distribution detection, depending on the data used during system training versus system testing. The incremental learning component of our pipeline is a zero-exemplar online model which performs comparatively against state-of-the-art on ImageNet-100 protocol and does not require any back-propagation or retraining of the underlying deep-network. It further outperforms the current state-of-the-art by simply using the same number of exemplars as its counterparts. To evaluate our approach for Open-World learning, we propose a new comprehensive protocol and evaluate its performance in both Out-of-Label and Out-of-Distribution settings for each incremental stage. We also demonstrate the adaptability of our approach by showing how it can work as a plug-in with any of the recently proposed self-supervised feature representation methods.},

In the present study, the participants were presented with films inducing a specific mood and were subsequently given a temporal bisection task. More precisely, the participants were given two temporal bisection tasks, one before and the other after viewing the emotional film. Three emotional films were tested: one eliciting fear, another sadness, and a neutral control film. In addition, the direct mood experience was assessed using the Brief Mood Introspective Scale that was administered to the participants at the beginning and the end of the session. The results showed that the perception of time did not change after viewing either the neutral control films or the sad films although the participants reported being sadder and less aroused after than before watching the sad film clips. In contrast, the stimulus durations were judged longer after than before viewing the frightening films that were judged to increase the emotion of fear and arousal level. In combination with findings from previous studies, our data suggest that the selective lengthening effect after watching frightening films was mediated by an effect of arousal on the speed of the internal clock system.},

In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed for continual learning, but due to differences in evaluation protocols it is difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more structured comparisons, we describe three continual learning scenarios based on whether at test time task identity is provided andâin case it is notâwhether it must be inferred. Any sequence of well-defined tasks can be performed according to each scenario. Using the split and permuted MNIST task protocols, for each scenario we carry out an extensive comparison of recently proposed continual learning methods. We demonstrate substantial differences between the three scenarios in terms of difficulty and in terms of how efficient different methods are. In particular, when task identity must be inferred (i.e., class incremental learning), we find that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) fail and that replaying representations of previous experiences seems required for solving this scenario.},

abstract = {Many processes are too complex to be manipulated quantitatively; however, humans succeed by using simple rules of thumb that are extracted from their experiences. Fuzzy logic emulates the human reasoning in the use of imprecise information to generate decisions. Unlike traditional approaches, which require a mathematical understanding of the system, fuzzy logic comprises an alternative way of processing, which permits modeling complex systems through the use of human knowledge. On the other hand, several new metaheuristic algorithms have recently been proposed with interesting results. Most of them use operators based on metaphors of natural or social elements to evolve candidate solutions. In this paper, a methodology to implement human-knowledge-based optimization strategies is presented. In the scheme, a Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy inference system is used to reproduce a specific search strategy generated by a human expert. Therefore, the number of rules and its configuration only depend on the expert experience without considering any learning rule process. Under these conditions, each fuzzy rule represents an expert observation that models the conditions under which candidate solutions are modified in order to reach the optimal location. To exhibit the performance and robustness of the proposed method, a comparison to other well-known optimization methods is conducted. The comparison considers several standard benchmark functions which are typically found in scientific literature. The results suggest a high performance of the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Hashing has shown great potential in large-scale image retrieval due to its storage and computation efficiency, especially the recent deep supervised hashing methods. To achieve promising performance, deep supervised hashing methods require a large amount of training data from different classes. However, when images of new categories emerge, existing deep hashing methods have to retrain the CNN model and generate hash codes for all the database images again, which is impractical for large-scale retrieval system. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing framework, called Deep Incremental Hashing Network (DIHN), for learning hash codes in an incremental manner. DIHN learns the hash codes for the new coming images directly, while keeping the old ones unchanged. Simultaneously, a deep hash function for query set is learned by preserving the similarities between training points. Extensive experiments on two widely used image retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed DIHN framework can significantly decrease the training time while keeping the state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy.},

abstract = {Black phosphorus, a newly emerged two-dimensional material, has attracted wide attention as novel photonic material. Here, multilayer black phosphorus is successfully fabricated by liquid phase exfoliation method. By employing black phosphorus as saturable absorber, we demonstrate a passively Q-switched Er-doped ZBLAN fiber laser at the wavelength of 2.8 $\mu$m. The modulation depth and saturation fluence of the black phosphorus saturable absorber are measured to be 15% and 9 $\mu$J/cm 2 , respectively. The Q-switched fiber laser delivers a maximum average power of 485 mW with corresponding pulse energy of 7.7 $\mu$J and pulse width of 1.18 $\mu$s at repetition rate of 63 kHz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to demonstrate that black phosphorus can realize Q-switching of 2.8-$\mu$m fiber laser. Our research results show that black phosphorus is a promising saturable absorber for mid-infrared pulsed lasers.

abstract = {Interactive retrieval for online fashion shopping provides the ability to change image retrieval results according to the user feedback. One common problem in interactive retrieval is that a specific user interaction (e.g., changing the color of a T-shirt) causes other aspects to change inadvertently (e.g., the retrieved item has a sleeve type different than the query). This is a consequence of existing methods learning visual representations that are semantically entangled in the embedding space, which limits the controllability of the retrieved results. We propose to leverage on the semantics of visual attributes to train convolutional networks that learn attribute-specific subspaces for each attribute to obtain disentangled representations. Thus operations, such as swapping out a particular attribute value for another, impact the attribute at hand and leave others untouched. We show that our model can be tailored to deal with different retrieval tasks while maintaining its disentanglement property. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on three interactive fashion retrieval tasks: attribute manipulation retrieval, conditional similarity retrieval, and outfit complementary item retrieval. Code and models are publicly available 1 .},

abstract = {In Continual Learning, a Neural Network is trained on a stream of data whose distribution shifts over time. Under these assumptions, it is especially challenging to improve on classes appearing later in the stream while remaining accurate on previous ones. This is due to the infamous problem of catastrophic forgetting, which causes a quick performance degradation when the classifier focuses on learning new categories. Recent literature proposed various approaches to tackle this issue, often resorting to very sophisticated techniques. In this work, we show that naive rehearsal can be patched to achieve similar performance. We point out some shortcomings that restrain Experience Replay (ER) and propose five tricks to mitigate them. Experiments show that ER, thus enhanced, displays an accuracy gain of 51.2 and 26.9 percentage points on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets respectively (memory buffer size 1000). As a result, it surpasses current state-of-the-art rehearsal-based methods.},

In this paper, we provide new tools and analyses to address these fundamental questions.

abstract = {Hydrogen is often considered the best means by which to store energy coming from renewable and intermittent power sources. With the growing capacity of localized renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required. PEM electrolysis provides a sustainable solution for the production of hydrogen, and is well suited to couple with energy sources such as wind and solar. However, due to low demand in electrolytic hydrogen in the last century, little research has been done on PEM electrolysis with many challenges still unexplored. The ever increasing desire for green energy has rekindled the interest on PEM electrolysis, thus the compilation and recovery of past research and developments is important and necessary. In this review, PEM water electrolysis is comprehensively highlighted and discussed. The challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts, solid electrolyte, current collectors, separator plates and modeling efforts will also be addressed. The main message is to clearly set the state-of-the-art for the PEM electrolysis technology, be insightful of the research that is already done and the challenges that still exist. This information will provide several future research directions and a road map in order to aid scientists in establishing PEM electrolysis as a commercially viable hydrogen production solution.

abstract = {Existing research into online multi-label classification, such as online sequential multi-label extreme learning machine (OSML-ELM) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), has achieved promising performance. However, these works do not take label dependencies into consideration and lack a theoretical analysis of loss functions. Accordingly, we propose a novel online metric learning paradigm for multi-label classification to fill the current research gap. Generally, we first propose a new metric for multi-label classification which is based on k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) and combined with large margin principle. Then, we adapt it to the online settting to derive our model which deals with massive volume ofstreaming data at a higher speed online. Specifically, in order to learn the new kNN-based metric, we first project instances in the training dataset into the label space, which make it possible for the comparisons of instances and labels in the same dimension. After that, we project both of them into a new lower dimension space simultaneously, which enables us to extract the structure of dependencies between instances and labels. Finally, we leverage the large margin and kNN principle to learn the metric with an efficient optimization algorithm. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on the upper bound of the cumulative loss for our method. Comprehensive experiments on a number of benchmark multi-label datasets validate our theoretical approach and illustrate that our proposed online metric learning (OML) algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

In this work, we study this problem from the perspective of information theory and define forgetting as the increase of description lengths of previous data when they are compressed with a sequentially learned model. In addition, we show that continual learning approaches based on variational posterior approximation and generative replay can be considered as approximations to two prequential coding methods in compression, namely, the Bayesian mixture code and maximum likelihood (ML) plug-in code. We compare these approaches in terms of both compression and forgetting and empirically study the reasons that limit the performance of continual learning methods based on variational posterior approximation. To address these limitations, we propose a new continual learning method that combines ML plug-in and Bayesian mixture codes.},

When replacing the last layer of the neural nets by our bi-temperature generalization of logistic loss, the training becomes more robust to noise. We visualize the effect of tuning the two temperatures in a simple setting and show the efficacy of our method on large data sets.

abstract = {We study continual learning in the large scale setting where tasks in the input sequence are not limited to classification, and the outputs can be of high dimension. Among multiple state-of-the-art methods, we found vanilla experience replay (ER) still very competitive in terms of both performance and scalability, despite its simplicity. However, a degraded performance is observed for ER with small memory. A further visualization of the feature space reveals that the intermediate representation undergoes a distributional drift. While existing methods usually replay only the input-output pairs, we hypothesize that their regularization effect is inadequate for complex deep models and diverse tasks with small replay buffer size. Following this observation, we propose to replay the activation of the intermediate layers in addition to the input-output pairs. Considering that saving raw activation maps can dramatically increase memory and compute cost, we propose the Compressed Activation Replay technique, where compressed representations of layer activation are saved to the replay buffer. We show that this approach can achieve superior regularization effect while adding negligible memory overhead to replay method. Experiments on both the large-scale Taskonomy benchmark with a diverse set of tasks and standard common datasets (Split-CIFAR and Split-miniImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Often, this challenge is compounded by the fact that there are latent or hidden confounders. When only observational data is available, the problem is ill-posed, i.e. the causal relationships are non-identifiable unless strong modeling assumptions are made. When interventions are available, we provide guarantees on identifiability and learnability under mild assumptions. We assume a linear structural equation model (SEM) with independent latent factors and directed acyclic graph (DAG) relationships among the observables. Since the latent variable inference is based on independent component analysis (ICA), we call this model SEM-ICA. We use the method of moments principle to establish model identifiability. We develop efficient algorithms based on coupled tensor decomposition with linear constraints to obtain scalable and guaranteed solutions. Thus, we provide a principled approach to tackling the joint problem of causal discovery and latent variable inference.},

Typically, the learner observes data only from a fixed number of classes at training time and is asked to generalize to a new set of classes at test time. Two examples from the same class would always be assigned the same labels in any episode. In this work, we consider a realistic setting where the similarities between examples can change from episode to episode depending on the task context, which is not given to the learner. We define new benchmark datasets for this flexible few-shot scenario, where the tasks are based on images of faces (Celeb-A), shoes (Zappos50K), and general objects (ImageNet-with-Attributes). While classification baselines and episodic approaches learn representations that work well for standard few-shot learning, they suffer in our flexible tasks as novel similarity definitions arise during testing. We propose to build upon recent contrastive unsupervised learning techniques and use a combination of instance and class invariance learning, aiming to obtain general and flexible features. We find that our approach performs strongly on our new flexible few-shot learning benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised learning obtains more generalizable representations.},

abstract = {Filter pruning is one of the most effective ways to accelerate and compress convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a global filter pruning algorithm called Gate Decorator, which transforms a vanilla CNN module by multiplying its output by the channel-wise scaling factors, i.e. gate. When the scaling factor is set to zero, it is equivalent to removing the corresponding filter. We use Taylor expansion to estimate the change in the loss function caused by setting the scaling factor to zero and use the estimation for the global filter importance ranking. Then we prune the network by removing those unimportant filters. After pruning, we merge all the scaling factors into its original module, so no special operations or structures are introduced. Moreover, we propose an iterative pruning framework called Tick-Tock to improve pruning accuracy. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. For example, we achieve the state-of-the-art pruning ratio on ResNet-56 by reducing 70% FLOPs without noticeable loss in accuracy. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet, our pruned model with 40% FLOPs reduction outperforms the baseline model by 0.31% in top-1 accuracy.

abstract = {Humans are capable of learning new tasks without forgetting previous ones, while neural networks fail due to catastrophic forgetting between new and previously-learned tasks. We consider a class-incremental setting which means that the task-ID is unknown at inference time. The imbalance between old and new classes typically results in a bias of the network towards the newest ones. This imbalance problem can either be addressed by storing exemplars from previous tasks, or by using image replay methods. However, the latter can only be applied to toy datasets since image generation for complex datasets is a hard problem. We propose a solution to the imbalance problem based on generative feature replay which does not require any exemplars. To do this, we split the network into two parts: a feature extractor and a classifier. To prevent forgetting, we combine generative feature replay in the classifier with feature distillation in the feature extractor. Through feature generation, our method reduces the complexity of generative replay and prevents the imbalance problem. Our approach is computationally efficient and scalable to large datasets. Experiments confirm that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, while requiring only a fraction of the storage needed for exemplar-based continual learning.

Our pruned VGG-16 achieves the state-of-the-art results by 5Ã speed-up along with only 0.3% increase of error.

Each digit is presented in a separate 42 Ã 42 input channel (giving 2-channel inputs), but each digit is transformed independently, with random rotation, scale, and translation (RTS). We train fully connected (FCN), convolutional (CNN) and single spatial transformer fully connected (ST-FCN) networks, as well as spatial transformer fully connected networks with two parallel spa-tial transformers (2ÃST-FCN) acting on the input image, each one taking both channels as input and transforming both channels.

abstract = {Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception tasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple learning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned visual and language representations also set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models. The representations also enable cross-modality search with complex text and text + image queries.},

abstract = { The shapes of terms used in fuzzy systems have adopted several 'conventions'. Terms are almost invariably normalised (having a maximum membership value of 1), convex (having a single maximum or plateau maxima) and distinct (being restricted in their degree of overlap: often expressed as some variation on the concept that all membership values at any point in the universe of discourse sum to I across that universe). The shape of these terms are generated by certain accepted membership functions: piecewise linear functions (with restrictions), Gaussians or Sigmoids are almost exclusively used. As such these constitute only a small subset of the total set of possible shapes of terms. These conventions are largely empirical or are justified by arguments based on what might loosely be called 'fuzzy control principles'. The paper highlights a number of membership functions that developers of fuzzy systems outside the paradigm of fuzzy control may consider as alternatives. In particular, we highlight subsumed fuzzy sets, discuss the merits of non-convex fuzzy sets and present a medical application where sub-normal fuzzy sets have been used. These ideas are reinforced by examples.},

abstract = {Continual learning, the setting where a learning agent is faced with a never ending stream of data, continues to be a great challenge for modern machine learning systems. In particular the online or "single-pass through the data" setting has gained attention recently as a natural setting that is difficult to tackle. Methods based on replay, either generative or from a stored memory, have been shown to be effective approaches for continual learning, matching or exceeding the state of the art in a number of standard benchmarks. These approaches typically rely on randomly selecting samples from the replay memory or from a generative model, which is suboptimal. In this work, we consider a controlled sampling of memories for replay. We retrieve the samples which are most interfered, i.e. whose prediction will be most negatively impacted by the foreseen parameters update. We show a formulation for this sampling criterion in both the generative replay and the experience replay setting, producing consistent gains in performance and greatly reduced forgetting.

The wind direction measured in the past minutes is used as input and the wind direction for the next two minutes constitutes the output. The two methods are based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM), respectively. For both methods we optimise the length of the moving average that we use to pre-process the input data, the length of the input vector and, for the ANN only, the number of neurons of each layer. The forecast is evaluated by looking at the mean absolute error and at a mean effectiveness index, which assesses the percentage of times that the forecast is accurate enough to predict the correct tactical choice in a sailing yacht race. The ANN forecast based on the ensemble average of ten networks shows a larger mean absolute error and a similar mean effectiveness index than the SVM forecast. However, we showed that the ANN forecast accuracy increases significantly with the size of the ensemble. Therefore increasing the computational power, it can lead to a better forecast.},

abstract = {My aim in this essay is to raise the question "Is there such a thing as mental illness?" and to argue that there is not. Since the notion of mental illness is extremely widely used nowadays, inquiry into the ways in which this term is employed would seem to be especially indicated. Mental illness, of course, is not literally a "thing" -- or physical object -- and hence it can "exist" only in the same sort of way in which other theoretical concepts exist. Yet, familiar theories are in the habit of posing, sooner or later -- at least to those who come to believe in them -- as "objective truths" (or "facts"). During certain historical periods, explanatory conceptions such as deities, witches, and microorganisms appeared not only as theories but as self-evident causes of a vast number of events. I submit that today mental illness is widely regarded in a somewhat similar fashion, that is, as the cause of innumerable diverse happenings. As an antidote to the complacent use of the notion of mental illness -- whether as a self-evident phenomenon, theory, or cause-- let us ask this question: What is meant when it is asserted that someone is mentally ill? In what follows I shall describe briefly the main uses to which the concept of mental illness has been put. I shall argue that this notion has outlived whatever usefulness it might have had and that it now functions merely as a convenient myth.},

The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},

abstract = {In order to robustly deploy object detectors across a wide range of scenarios, they should be adaptable to shifts in the input distribution without the need to constantly annotate new data. This has motivated research in Unsu-pervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) algorithms for detection. UDA methods learn to adapt from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, by inducing alignment between detector features from source and target domains. Yet, there is no consensus on what features to align and how to do the alignment. In our work, we propose a framework that generalizes the different components commonly used by UDA methods laying the ground for an in-depth analysis of the UDA design space. Specifically, we propose a novel UDA algorithm, ViSGA, a direct implementation of our framework, that leverages the best design choices and introduces a simple but effective method to aggregate features at instance-level based on visual similarity before inducing group alignment via adversarial training. We show that both similarity-based grouping and adversarial training allows our model to focus on coarsely aligning feature groups, without being forced to match all instances across loosely aligned domains. Finally, we examine the applicability of ViSGA to the setting where labeled data are gathered from different sources. Experiments show that not only our method outperforms previous single-source approaches on Sim2Real and Adverse Weather, but also generalizes well to the multi-source setting.},

abstract = {In this paper, a correlation between vibration amplitude and tool wear when in dry turning of AISI 4140 steel using uncoated carbide insert DNMA 432 is analyzed via experiments and finite element simulations. 3D Finite element simulations results are utilized to predict the evolution of cutting forces, vibration displacement amplitudes and tool wear in vibration induced turning. In the present paper, the primary concern is to find the relative vibration and tool wear with the variation of process parameters. These changes lead to accelerated tool wear and even breakage. The cutting forces in the feed direction are also predicted and compared with the experimental trends. A laser Doppler vibrometer is used to detect vibration amplitudes and the usage of Kistler 9272 dynamometer for recording the cutting forces during the cutting process is well demonstrated. A sincere effort is put to investigate the influence of spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut on vibration amplitude and tool flank wear at different levels of workpiece hardness. Empirical models have been developed using second order polynomial equations for correlating the interaction and higher order influences of various process parameters. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is carried out to identify the significant factors that are affecting the vibration amplitude and tool flank wear. Response surface methodology (RSM) is implemented to investigate the progression of flank wear and displacement amplitude based on experimental data. While measuring the displacement amplitude, R-square values for experimental and numerical methods are 98.6 and 97.8. Based on the R-square values of ANOVA it is found that the numerical values show good agreement with the experimental values and are helpful in estimating displacement amplitude. In the case of predicting the tool wear, R-square values were found to be 97.69 and 96.08, respectively for numerical and experimental measures while determining the tool wear. By taking R-square values into account, ANOVA confirms the close relation between experimental values and numerical values in evaluating the tool wear.},

abstract = {All few-shot learning techniques must be pre-trained on a large, labeled âbase datasetâ. In problem domains where such large labeled datasets are not available for pre-training (e.g., X-ray images), one must resort to pre-training in a different âsourceâ problem domain (e.g., ImageNet), which can be very different from the desired target task. Traditional few-shot and transfer learning techniques fail in the presence of such extreme differences between the source and target tasks. In this paper, we present a simple and effective solution to tackle this extreme domain gap: self-training a source domain representation on unlabeled data from the target domain. We show that this improves one-shot performance on the target domain by 2.9 points on average on a challenging benchmark with multiple domains.},

@article{Kamranzad2011,
abstract = {Forecasting of wave parameters is necessary for many marine and coastal operations. Different forecasting methodologies have been developed using the wind and wave characteristics. In this paper, artificial neural network (ANN) as a robust data learning method is used to forecast the wave height for the next 3, 6, 12 and 24 h in the Persian Gulf. To determine the effective parameters, different models with various combinations of input parameters were considered. Parameters such as wind speed, direction and wave height of the previous 3 h, were found to be the best inputs. Furthermore, using the difference between wave and wind directions showed better performance. The results also indicated that if only the wind parameters are used as model inputs the accuracy of the forecasting increases as the time horizon increases up to 6 h. This can be due to the lower influence of previous wave heights on larger lead time forecasting and the existing lag between the wind and wave growth. It was also found that in short lead times, the forecasted wave heights primarily depend on the previous wave heights, while in larger lead times there is a greater dependence on previous wind speeds. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.

The principal goal when dealing with this scenario is to dynamically exploit the existing complementarities among the problems (tasks) being optimized, helping each other through the exchange of valuable knowledge. Additionally, the emerging paradigm of Evolutionary Multitasking tackles multitask optimization scenarios by using as inspiration concepts drawn from Evolutionary Computation. The main purpose of this survey is to collect, organize and critically examine the abundant literature published so far in Evolutionary Multitasking, with an emphasis on the methodological patterns followed when designing new algorithmic proposals in this area (namely, multifactorial optimization and multipopulation-based multitasking). We complement our critical analysis with an identification of challenges that remain open to date, along with promising research directions that can stimulate future efforts in this topic. Our discussions held throughout this manuscript are offered to the audience as a reference of the general trajectory followed by the community working in this field in recent times, as well as a self-contained entry point for newcomers and researchers interested to join this exciting research avenue.},

@article{Du2009,
abstract = {In our previous research, we applied independent component analysis (ICA) for the restoration of image sequences degraded by atmospheric turbulence. The original high-resolution image and turbulent sources were considered independent sources from which the degraded image is composed of. Although the result was promising, the assumption of source independence may not be true in practice. In this paper, we propose to apply the concept of dependent component analysis (DCA), which can relax the independence assumption, to image restoration. In addition, the restored image can be further enhanced by employing a recently developed Gabor-filter-bank-based single channel blind image deconvolution algorithm. Both simulated and real data experiments demonstrate that DCA outperforms ICA, resulting in the flexibility in the use of adjacent image frames. The contribution of this research is to convert the original multi-frame blind deconvolution problem into blind source separation problem without the assumption on source independence; as a result, there is no a priori information, such as sensor bandwidth, point-spread-function, or statistics of source images, that is required. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We observe that the current standard procedure for training DNNs discards all the learned information in the past epochs except the current learned weights. An interesting question is: is this discarded information indeed useless? We argue that the discarded information can benefit the subsequent training. In this paper, we propose learning with retrospection (LWR) which makes use of the learned information in the past epochs to guide the subsequent training. LWR is a simple yet effective training framework to improve accuracies, calibration, and robustness of DNNs without introducing any additional network parameters or inference cost, only with a negligible training overhead. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of LWR for training DNNs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. In order to produce reliable weather forecasts, it is essential to discriminate non-meteorological targets from rain clouds in weather radar data. Identification of chaff echoes, which is one of the main noise sources, is uncertain and imprecise for skilled weather experts because characteristics of them are similar to those of precipitation echoes. This paper uses treeinitialized fuzzy classifier (FC) to identify chaff echoes. Fuzzy models have been widely applied to the domain of uncertainty and vagueness. Classification and regression tree is used to generate an initial crisp model (a set of crisp rules). The number of the rules, corresponding to complexity of the model, is systematically determined by performance criterion. Finally, after transforming the crisp model to the fuzzy one straightforwardly, parameters of the FCs are optimized by genetic algorithms. FCs have more flexible decision boundaries than binary decision trees with rectangular partitioning. In order to evaluate identification performance, the FCs, and comparison methods are applied to many cases where both chaff and nonchaff echoes occurred simultaneously. The results of experiments show that the FCs achieve the best identification performance.},

Anecdotally, digressions from a moral code are often described as a series of small breaches that grow over time. Here we provide empirical evidence for a gradual escalation of self-serving dishonesty and reveal a neural mechanism supporting it. Behaviorally, we show that the extent to which participants engage in self-serving dishonesty increases with repetition. Using functional MRI, we show that signal reduction in the amygdala is sensitive to the history of dishonest behavior, consistent with adaptation. Critically, the extent of reduced amygdala sensitivity to dishonesty on a present decision relative to the previous one predicts the magnitude of escalation of self-serving dishonesty on the next decision. The findings uncover a biological mechanism that supports a 'slippery slope': what begins as small acts of dishonesty can escalate into larger transgressions.},

We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1% of the labels, we achieve 85.8% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

One strand of research has used probabilistic regularization for continual learning, with two of the main approaches in this vein being Online Elastic Weight Consolidation (Online EWC) and Variational Continual Learning (VCL). VCL employs variational inference, which in other settings has been improved empirically by applying likelihood-tempering. We show that applying this modification to VCL recovers Online EWC as a limiting case, allowing for interpolation between the two approaches. We term the general algorithm Generalized VCL (GVCL). In order to mitigate the observed overpruning effect of VI, we take inspiration from a common multi-task architecture, neural networks with task-specific FiLM layers, and find that this addition leads to significant performance gains, specifically for variational methods. In the small-data regime, GVCL strongly outperforms existing baselines. In larger datasets, GVCL with FiLM layers outperforms or is competitive with existing baselines in terms of accuracy, whilst also providing significantly better calibration.},

Recently many parking detection systems using range-based on-vehicle sensors are invented, but they disregard the practical difficulty of obtaining access to raw sensory data which are required for any feature-based algorithm.

The challenge that the data transmitted through ADAS unit has been encoded to sparse points is overcome by a statistical method instead of feature extractions. We propose a two-step classification algorithm combining Mean-Shift clustering and Support Vector Machine to analyze SRR-GPS data, and evaluate it through field experiments. The results show that the average Type I error rate for off-street parking is $15.23 \%$ and for on-street parking is $32.62\%$. In both cased the Type II error rates are less than $20 \%$.

abstract = {This chapter describes properties, production, and application of borides. Borides do not conform to the ordinary concepts of valency, either in stoichiometry or in structure. The stoichiometry of metal borides ranges from compounds with low boron content. The spatial distribution of boron atoms is characteristic for all these compounds, changing from isolated boron atoms to pairs, chains, and three-dimensional connected networks in the boron-rich borides, the number of boron-boron interactions increasing with increasing boron content. The covalent bonding of the boron atoms can be considered as a reason for the commonly observed high hardness and high melting points of the borides. The hardness and wear resistance of the metal borides are the most common properties utilized in technical applications. In the boronizing process, boride layers are formed on the surface of metal parts or hard metal-cutting tools during heat treatment, thus improving lifetime and service performance under wear conditions. Hexaborides of the alkaline-earth metals and rare earth metals are valuable cathode materials for electron emission. It is found that very high current densities can be achieved at rather low emission temperatures compared with metal electrodes.},

abstract = {Current attention or transform modules in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed pursuing lightweight and in-place. Generally, we need to decrease the channel dimension of input feature maps for reducing computation cost firstly. And then we do some transformation for extracting weight maps or converting to other feature space etc. Finally, we increase the channel dimension back for outputting feature maps with the same size as input. When we change the channel dimension, commonly we choose $1\times 1$ convolutional layers or fully connected layers. They are simple and effective, but need learning parameters and consuming more memory with other computation resources. We propose a novel parameter free method named Channel Transformer Network (CTN) to decrease or increase channels for these modules whilst keeping most information with lower computation complexity. We also introduce a Video Co-segment Attentive Network (VCAN) for person re-identification (ReID) to improve pedestrian's noticeable representation across multiple video frames. We embed CTN in Non-local, CBAM, COSAM and VCAN blocks to replace $1\times 1$ convolutional or fully connected layers. Experiments of VCAN and CTN embedding models on Mars dataset for person ReID show significant performance in computation efficiency and accuracy, especially VCAN reaches 90.05% in Rank-1. We believe CTN can also be used in other vision tasks like image classification and object detection etc.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher. Countries with a tropical climate, such as Indonesia, are highly dependent on rainfall prediction for many sectors, such as agriculture, aviation, and shipping. Rainfall has now become increasingly unpredictable due to climate change and this phenomenon also affects Indonesia. Therefore, a robust approach is required for more accurate rainfall prediction. The Tsukamoto Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is one of the algorithms that can be used for prediction problems, but if its membership functions are not specified properly, the prediction error is still high. To improve the results, the boundaries of the membership functions can be adjusted automatically by using a genetic algorithm. The proposed genetic algorithm employs two selection processes. The first one uses the Roulette wheel method to select parents, while the second one uses the elitism method to select chromosomes for the next generation. Based on this approach, a rainfall prediction experiment was conducted for Tengger, Indonesia using historical rainfall data for ten-year periods. The proposed method generated root mean square errors (RMSE) of 6.78 and 6.63 for the areas of Tosari and Tutur respectively. These results are better compared with the results using Tsukamoto FIS and the Generalized Space Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) model from previous studies.},

abstract = {Despite the growing interest in continual learning, most of its contemporary works have been studied in a rather restricted setting where tasks are clearly distinguish-able, and task boundaries are known during training. However, if our goal is to develop an algorithm that learns as humans do, this setting is far from realistic, and it is essential to develop a methodology that works in a task-free manner. Meanwhile , among several branches of continual learning, expansion-based methods have the advantage of eliminating catastrophic forgetting by allocating new resources to learn new data. In this work, we propose an expansion-based approach for task-free continual learning. Our model, named Continual Neural Dirichlet Process Mixture (CN-DPM), consists of a set of neural network experts that are in charge of a subset of the data. CN-DPM expands the number of experts in a principled way under the Bayesian nonparametric framework. With extensive experiments, we show that our model successfully performs task-free continual learning for both discriminative and generative tasks such as image classification and image generation.},

abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

abstract = {In the last few years in large and medium-sized Italian cities, the motorization index experienced a small reduction compared to its continuous growth in the previous decades for the first time. Furthermore, at the same time, many cities (both Italian and foreign) have set the improvement of public spaces as one of the main objectives of their urban planning strategies, such as removing âon-streetâ parking to create larger space for pedestrians and social activities. Therefore, management of parking supply and demand has emerged as an important theme. The analysis of some European and American case studies (particularly London, UK, and San Francisco, CA) revealed the existence of innovative plans and actions in urban planning (i.e. the introduction of a maximum standard for parking spaces) and parking strategies (i.e. the implementation of variable parking pricing). Such innovative tools can be considered the starting point of a new parking management optimization process. In particular, the variability of parking pricing in relation to the occupancy index is considered a good method to ensure an âidealâ maximum percentage of occupied parking spaces (ranging between 60% and 80%) mainly in âoff-streetâ parking. This paper firstly aims to provide some guidance for a future application of the performance-based pricing schemes in to the Italian context, based on the results of a recent experiment on variable pricing techniques in San Francisco, California (the âSFparkâ programme). This paper wants to encourage the real experimentation in Italy showing with the simulation the potential of this method. Then, this paper describes an Italian case study; the feasibility of potential application of similar techniques was investigated for an off-street parking structure located close to the city centre of Brescia, a medium-sized Italian city, through simulation of the effects that a change in parking fees could have on the occupancy index.},

Through the extensive application of advanced manufacturing technology like 3D print technology, flexible production technology and reconfigurable production system, the importance of large-scale standardized production under the guidance of scale economy in modern market declines gradually, and more and more attention is paid to the scope economy idea that can adapt to the market rapidly and satisfy consumers' individualized needs. By analyzing the trend and essence of the third industrial revolution, this paper expounds the impacts that might be caused to Chinese traditional manufacturing industry, such as the reduction of labor cost advantage, localization and decentralization of production mode, gradual deepening of service degree in manufacturing industry, and suppression on the traditional industry upgrading path and industrialization process.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018. The Authors. Two algorithms based on machine learning neural networks are proposedâthe shallow learning (S-L) and deep learning (D-L) algorithmsâthat can potentially be used in atmosphere-only typhoon forecast models to provide flow-dependent typhoon-induced sea surface temperature cooling (SSTC) for improving typhoon predictions. The major challenge of existing SSTC algorithms in forecast models is how to accurately predict SSTC induced by an upcoming typhoon, which requires information not only from historical data but more importantly also from the target typhoon itself. The S-L algorithm composes of a single layer of neurons with mixed atmospheric and oceanic factors. Such a structure is found to be unable to represent correctly the physical typhoon-ocean interaction. It tends to produce an unstable SSTC distribution, for which any perturbations may lead to changes in both SSTC pattern and strength. The D-L algorithm extends the neural network to a 4Â ÃÂ 5 neuron matrix with atmospheric and oceanic factors being separated in different layers of neurons, so that the machine learning can determine the roles of atmospheric and oceanic factors in shaping the SSTC. Therefore, it produces a stable crescent-shaped SSTC distribution, with its large-scale pattern determined mainly by atmospheric factors (e.g., winds) and small-scale features by oceanic factors (e.g., eddies). Sensitivity experiments reveal that the D-L algorithms improve maximum wind intensity errors by 60â70% for four case study simulations, compared to their atmosphere-only model runs.},

Kebutuhan energi listrik untuk operasional gedung disuplai dari PLN sebagai sumber utama dengan daya sebesar 240 kVA dan sumber listrik cadangan (genset) berkapasitas 250 kVA. Kualitas daya listrik yang disuplai oleh PLN melalui transformator distribusi pada gedung tersebut cukup baik, dari hasil pengukuran parameter tegangan, arus dan faktor daya (power factor) masih memenuhi standard mutu yang ditetapkan oleh IEC. Komposisi pengguna energi terbagi dalam tiga kelompok beban yaitu; beban penerangan 4,54%, air conditioner (AC) 57,36% dan peralatan kantor lainnya 38,10%. Berdasarkan standard konservasi energi yang digunakan oleh Departemen Pendidikan Nasional Republik Indonesia dan ASEAN â USAID, intensitas konsumsi energi (IKE) dalam gedung digolongkan dalam dua bagian yaitu ruangan ber-AC dan tanpa AC. Penggunaan energi listrik rata-rata dari rekening listrik selama 8 bulan dari bulan maret sampai dengan Oktober 2011 adalah sebesar 39,593 kWh/bulan, dengan tariff rata-rata sebesar Rp 966,10 /kWh. Potensi penghematan dari selisih penggunaan energi dari penggantian AC konvensional dengan AC inverter hemat energi untuk seluruh gedung kantor direksi PT. PN XIII (Persero) adalah sebesar Rp 13,083,536 /bulan atau Rp 157,002,429 /tahun. Penggantian lampu TL dengan lampu LED tidak terlalu signifikan dalam penurunan rekening listrik karena prosentasenya cukup kecil, namun dalam jangka panjang akan berdampak positip bagi lingkungan, juga panas yang dihasilkan oleh lampu LED jauh lebih rendah (lebih sejuk) dari lampu lain sehingga dapat menurunkan beban kerja AC, dan apabila teknologinya sudah lebih murah, lampu LED merupakan alternatif pilihan yang tepat untuk solusi hemat energi pada sistem penerangan.

This can greatly help transmission and distribution system operators and schedulers to improve the power network control and management. In this paper, a double stage hierarchical genetic algorithm based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (double-stage hybrid GA-ANFIS) approach is proposed for short-term wind power forecast of a microgrid wind farm in Beijing, China. The approach has two hierarchical stages. The first GA-ANFIS stage utilizes numerical weather prediction (NWP) meteorological parameters to predict wind speed at the wind farm exact site and turbine hub height. The second stage maps the actual wind speed and power relationships. Then, the forecasted next day's wind speed by the first stage is applied to the second stage to predict next day's wind power. The presented approach has achieved considerable prediction accuracy enhancement. The accuracy of the proposed model is compared with other four forecasting methods and resulted in the best accuracy improvement of all.},

abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are popular for many computer vision tasks, including multi-label classification. Since RNNs produce sequential outputs, labels need to be ordered for the multi-label classification task. Current approaches sort labels according to their frequency, typically ordering them in either rare-first or frequent-first. These imposed orderings do not take into account that the natural order to generate the labels can change for each image, e.g. first the dominant object before summing up the smaller objects in the image. Therefore, we propose ways to dynamically order the ground truth labels with the predicted label sequence. This allows for faster training of more optimal LSTM models. Analysis evidences that our method does not suffer from duplicate generation, something which is common for other models. Furthermore, it outperforms other CNN-RNN models, and we show that a standard architecture of an image encoder and language decoder trained with our proposed loss obtains the state-of-the-art results on the challenging MS-COCO, WIDER Attribute and PA-100K and competitive results on NUS-WIDE.},

Our model is trained to capture the internal distribution of patches within the image, and is then able to generate high quality, diverse samples that carry the same visual content as the image. SinGAN contains a pyramid of fully convolutional GANs, each responsible for learning the patch distribution at a different scale of the image. This allows generating new samples of arbitrary size and aspect ratio, that have significant variability, yet maintain both the global structure and the fine textures of the training image. In contrast to previous single image GAN schemes, our approach is not limited to texture images, and is not conditional (i.e. it generates samples from noise). User studies confirm that the generated samples are commonly confused to be real images. We illustrate the utility of SinGAN in a wide range of image manipulation tasks.},

abstract = {Nanotechnology is utilized well in the development and improvement of the performance in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs). The high operating temperature of SOFCs (700â900 Â°C) has resulted in serious demerits regarding their overall performance and durability. Therefore, the operating temperature has been reduced to an intermediate temperature range of approximately 400â700 Â°C which improved performance and, subsequently, commercialized SOFCs as portable power sources. However, at reduced temperature, challenges such as an increase in internal resistance of the fuel cell components arise. Although, this may not be as serious as problems encountered at high temperature, it still significantly affects the performance of SOFCs. This review paper addresses the work of researchers in the application of nanotechnology in fabricating SOFCs through distinct methods. These methods have successfully omitted or at least reduced the internal resistance and showed considerable improvement in power density of the SOFCs at reduced temperatures.},

abstract = {Model efficiency has become increasingly important in computer vision. In this paper, we systematically study various neural network architecture design choices for object detection and propose several key optimizations to improve efficiency. First, we propose a weighted bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN), which allows easy and fast multi-scale feature fusion; Second, we propose a compound scaling method that uniformly scales the resolution, depth, and width for all backbone, feature network, and box/class prediction networks at the same time. Based on these optimizations, we have developed a new family of object detectors, called EfficientDet, which consistently achieve an order-of-magnitude better efficiency than prior art across a wide spectrum of resource constraints. In particular, without bells and whistles, our EfficientDet-D7 achieves stateof-the-art 51.0 mAP on COCO dataset with 52M parameters and 326B FLOPS1 , being 4x smaller and using 9.3x fewer FLOPS yet still more accurate (+0.3% mAP) than the best previous detector.},

Various exogenous NIR fluorophores have been developed for the technique, including small molecule fluorophores and nanoparticles. NIRF imaging has been used in animal models for the detection of cancer overthe last twenty years and has in recent years been used in human clinical trials.\n\nAREAS COVERED: This article describes the types and characteristics of exogenous fluorophores available for in vivo fluorescent cancer imaging. The article also discusses the progression of NIRF cancer imaging over recent years and its future challenges, from both a biological and clinical perspective. in The review also looks at its application for lymph node mapping, tumor targeting and characterization, and tumor margin definition for surgical guidance.\n\nEXPERT OPINION: NIRF imaging is not in routine clinical cancer practice; yet, the authors predict that techniques using NIR fluorophores for tumor margin definition and lymph node mapping will enter clinical practice in the near future. The authors also anticipate that NIRF imaging research will lead to the development of flurophores with 'high brightness' that will overcome the limited penetration of this modality and be better suited for non invasive tumor targeting.},

There is possibility for insulin-producing cells (IPCs) to be differentiated from mesenchymal cells. We used self-functional repair stimuli of stem cells by partial injury. Rat pancreatic extract (RPE) from the regenerating pancreas (2 days after 60% pancreatectomy) was treated to rat mesenchymal cells. After the treatment of RPE, they made clusters like islet of Langerhans within a week and expressed four pancreatic endocrine hormones; insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin. Moreover, IPCs released insulin in response to normal glucose challenge. Here we demonstrate that the treatment of RPE can differentiate rat mesenchymal cells into IPCs which can be a potential source for the therapy of diabetes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Vector representation is a common approach for expressing the meaning of a relational pattern. Most previous work obtained a vector of a relational pattern based on the distribution of its context words (e.g., arguments of the relational pattern), regarding the pattern as a single 'word'. However, this approach suffers from the data sparseness problem, because relational patterns are productive, i.e., produced by combinations of words. To address this problem, we propose a novel method for computing the meaning of a relational pattern based on the semantic compositionality of constituent words. We extend the Skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013) to handle semantic compositions of relational patterns using recursive neural networks. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method for modeling the meanings of relational patterns, and demonstrate the contribution of this work to the task of relation extraction.},

abstract = {Modern object detectors rely heavily on rectangular bounding boxes, such as anchors, proposals and the final predictions, to represent objects at various recognition stages. The bounding box is convenient to use but provides only a coarse localization of objects and leads to a correspondingly coarse extraction of object features. In this paper, we present \textbf{RepPoints} (representative points), a new finer representation of objects as a set of sample points useful for both localization and recognition. Given ground truth localization and recognition targets for training, RepPoints learn to automatically arrange themselves in a manner that bounds the spatial extent of an object and indicates semantically significant local areas. They furthermore do not require the use of anchors to sample a space of bounding boxes. We show that an anchor-free object detector based on RepPoints can be as effective as the state-of-the-art anchor-based detection methods, with 46.5 AP and 67.4 $AP_{50}$ on the COCO test-dev detection benchmark, using ResNet-101 model.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

First, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate models learning over a continuum of data. These metrics characterize models not only by their test accuracy, but also in terms of their ability to transfer knowledge across tasks. Second, we propose a model for continual learning, called Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) that alleviates forgetting, while allowing beneficial transfer of knowledge to previous tasks.

In particular, they are vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting, i.e. they perform poorly when they are required to update their model as new classes are available but the original training set is not retained. This paper addresses this problem in the context of semantic segmentation. Current strategies fail on this task because they do not consider a peculiar aspect of semantic segmentation: since each training step provides annotation only for a subset of all possible classes, pixels of the background class (i.e. pixels that do not belong to any other classes) exhibit a semantic distribution shift. In this work we revisit classical incremental learning methods, proposing a new distillation-based framework which explicitly accounts for this shift. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy to initialize classifier's parameters, thus preventing biased predictions toward the background class. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an extensive evaluation on the Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, significantly outperforming state of the art incremental learning methods.},

abstract = {We propose a greedy strategy to train a deep network for multi-class classification, where each layer is defined as a composition of a linear projection and a nonlinear mapping. This nonlinear mapping is defined as the feature map of a Gaussian kernel, and the linear projection is learned by maximizing the dependence between the layer output and the labels, using the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as the dependence measure. Since each layer is trained greedily in sequence, all learning is local, and neither backpropagation nor even gradient descent is needed. The depth and width of the network are determined via natural guidelines, and the procedure regularizes its weights in the linear layer. As the key theoretical result, the function class represented by the network is proved to be sufficiently rich to learn any dataset labeling using a finite number of layers, in the sense of reaching minimum mean-squared error or cross-entropy, as long as no two data points with different labels coincide. Experiments demonstrate good generalization performance of the greedy approach across multiple benchmarks while showing a significant computational advantage against a multilayer perceptron of the same complexity trained globally by backpropagation.},

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {The accelerating and frequently fluctuating price of conventional diesel, together with growing environmental concerns has sparked renewed attention on the search for an alternative fuel. The awareness of the toxic effects related to the tailpipe emissions of vehicles has driven many countries to look for a less-polluted transportation fuel. In this regard, biodiesel (alkyl esters) from vegetable oils or animal fats via transesterification is regarded as the most viable alternative as a green fuel for diesel engines. Transesterification is a catalyzed process and, traditionally, homogeneous catalysts are employed. However, this type of catalyst is not able to be reused and requires tedious washing and separating steps, hence, stimulating the conception of heterogeneous-catalyzed transesterification. Despite the success of various heterogeneous catalysts, many are not viable for wide industrial usage as most of the catalysts are expensive and need additional preparation effort. Among them, CaO seems to have a promising place and the increasing research on CaO is self-evidence of its capability in catalyzing the reaction. Therefore, in this paper, various issues regarding CaO-catalyzed transesterification are reviewed. The diverse performance of CaO in neat, loaded and mixed forms, as well as a support for other catalyst systems, CaO reaction mechanism, CaO tolerance to low to moderate oil qualities and reaction conditions, the conformance of CaO-catalyzed biodiesel to key specifications and the future outlook and the challenges of the catalyst are suitably addressed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Most of the existing artificial neural networks(ANNs) fail to learn continually due to catastrophic forgetting, while humans can do the same by maintaining previous tasks' performances. Although storing all the previous data can alleviate the problem, it takes a large memory, infeasible in real-world utilization. We propose a continual zero-shot learning model that is more suitable in real-case scenarios to address the issue that can learn sequentially and distinguish classes the model has not seen during training. We present a hybrid network that consists of a shared VAE module to hold information of all tasks and task-specific private VAE modules for each task. The model's size grows with each task to prevent catastrophic forgetting of task-specific skills, and it includes a replay approach to preserve shared skills. We demonstrate our hybrid model is effective on several datasets, i.e., CUB, AWA1, AWA2, and aPY. We show our method is superior on class sequentially learning with ZSL(Zero-Shot Learning) and GZSL(Generalized Zero-Shot Learning).},

abstract = {FERROELECTRIC materials are characterized by a switchable macroscopic polarization. Most technologically important ferroelectrics are oxides with a perovskite structure. The origin of their ferroelectric behaviour is unclear, however, and there is incomplete understanding of why similar, but chemically different, perovskites should display very different ferroelectric behaviour. The great sensitivity of ferroelectrics to chemistry, defects, electrical boundary conditions and pressure arises from a delicate balance between long-range Coulomb forces (which favour the ferroelectric state) and short-range repulsions (which favour the nonpolar cubic structure). To model the transition accurately, total-energy techniques are required which incorporate the effects of charge distortion and covalency. Here I report results of electronic-structure calculations on two classic examples of ferroelectric perovskites, BaTiO3 and PbTiO3, and demonstrate that hybridization between the titanium 3d states and the oxygen 2p states is essential for ferroelectricity. The different ferroelectric phase behaviour of the two materials is also clear: in PbTiO3, the lead and oxygen states hybridize, leading to a large strain that stabilizes the tetragonal phase, whereas in BaTiO3 the interaction between barium and oxygen is completely ionic, favouring a rhombohedral structure.},

abstract = {The explosive growth of image data facilitates the fast development of image processing and computer vision methods for emerging visual applications, meanwhile introducing novel distortions to the processed images. This poses a grand challenge to existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models, failing to continually adapt to such subpopulation shift. Recent work suggests training BIQA methods on the combination of all available human-rated IQA datasets. However, this type of approach is not scalable to a large number of datasets, and is cumbersome to incorporate a newly created dataset as well. In this paper, we formulate continual learning for BIQA, where a model learns continually from a stream of IQA datasets, building on what was learned from previously seen data. We first identify five desiderata in the new setting with a measure to quantify the plasticity-stability trade-off. We then propose a simple yet effective method for learning BIQA models continually. Specifically, based on a shared backbone network, we add a prediction head for a new dataset, and enforce a regularizer to allow all prediction heads to evolve with new data while being resistant to catastrophic forgetting of old data. We compute the quality score by an adaptive weighted summation of estimates from all prediction heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promise of the proposed continual learning method in comparison to standard training techniques for BIQA.},

With the presence of base catalyst, biodiesel can be easily produced via transesterification of triglyceride with alcohol under mild reaction conditions. Utilization of green catalysts from natural waste shells for biodiesel synthesis is capable of reducing the cost of catalyst which is beneficial to overall production cost. In this study, we have developed a modified CaO catalyst from natural waste clamshell (Meretrix meretrix) via hydration-dehydration treatment for transesterification process. The effects of hydration duration on clamshell were investigated to achieve the most optimum characteristic and catalytic activity. The surface area and the basicity of the treated catalyst increased extensively with prolonged hydration duration technique. By prolonging the water treatment process, it shall allow more formation of Ca(OH)<inf>2</inf> which then has promoted the formation of Bronsted base sites for higher basicity.

abstract = {The successes of deep learning, variational inference, and many other fields have been aided by specialized implementations of reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) to compute gradients of mega-dimensional objectives. The AD techniques underlying these tools were designed to compute exact gradients to numerical precision, but modern machine learning models are almost always trained with stochastic gradient descent. Why spend computation and memory on exact (minibatch) gradients only to use them for stochastic optimization? We develop a general framework and approach for randomized automatic differentiation (RAD), which allows unbiased gradient estimates to be computed with reduced memory in return for variance. We examine limitations of the general approach, and argue that we must leverage problem specific structure to realize benefits. We develop RAD techniques for a variety of simple neural network architectures, and show that for a fixed memory budget, RAD converges in fewer iterations than using a small batch size for feedforward networks, and in a similar number for recurrent networks. We also show that RAD can be applied to scientific computing, and use it to develop a low-memory stochastic gradient method for optimizing the control parameters of a linear reaction-diffusion PDE representing a fission reactor.},

A fitting ANN was used to estimate temperature and relative humidity in different locations inside the tobacco dryer and to predict them with different time horizons. An error under 2% can be achieved when estimating temperature as a function of temperature and relative humidity in other locations. Moreover, an error around 1.5 times lower than that obtained with an interpolation method can be achieved when predicting the temperature inside the tobacco mass as a function of its present and past values with time horizons over 150 minutes. These results show that the tobacco drying process can be improved taking into account the predicted future value of the monitored variables and the estimated actual value of other variables using a fitting ANN as proposed.},

abstract = {A data driven Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) employs Membership Functions (MFs) with adjustable parameters in its IF part to fuzzify the input data. The input space is partitioned simply by dividing universe of discourse of each input variable into some fuzzy subspaces. The MFs are then defined on the fuzzy subspaces of the input variables. Parameters of the MFs are tuned for maximum accuracy of the system (which demands high runtime) without considering the data structure which impairs interpretability of the FIS and degenerates the system into a black-box tool. Such a FIS does not represent actual structure of the data and its MFs are not necessarily in accord with the data distribution in the input space. In addition, the FIS suffers from exponential complexity of order O(Tr) where T is number of linguistic terms (number of subspaces on the universe of discourse of input variables) and r is number of input variables. This article presents a novel Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output Clustering based Fuzzy Inference System (MIMO CFIS) which is made directly from a class of fuzzy clustering algorithms to overcome these shortcomings. CFIS identifies dense regions of the input data using fuzzy clustering and then places a cluster on each of these regions. These fuzzy clusters represent actual structure of the data and serve as fuzzy rules in the rule base of CFIS and provide MFs that exactly fit the dense regions of the data that makes the system more interpretable and avoids redundant rules. These MFs are normal, convex, and continuous and have no parameter to be tuned (which makes CFIS much faster than other FISs) and fuzzify the input data according to their membership in the clusters. THEN part of CFIS is generalized form of THEN part of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system which accommodates any function of input variables. Despite less number of adjustable parameters, testing error of CFIS is less than that of TS system and its modified versions. Moreover, number of fuzzy rules in CFIS rule base is the same as the number of linguistic terms (or fuzzy clusters) and consequently its complexity is of orderO(T). Also, CFIS is a MIMO system and avoids inconsistent (contradictory) rules by generating well-separated fuzzy clusters whereas TS system is MISO and never guarantees generation of consistent rules. In addition, CFIS satisfies most of the interpretability criteria of FISs.},

However, these methods implicitly assume a particular set of representational invariances (e.g., invariance to color), and can perform poorly when a downstream task violates this assumption (e.g., distinguishing red vs. yellow cars). We introduce a contrastive learning framework which does not require prior knowledge of specific, task-dependent invariances. Our model learns to capture varying and invariant factors for visual representations by constructing separate embedding spaces, each of which is invariant to all but one augmentation. We use a multi-head network with a shared backbone which captures information across each augmentation and alone outperforms all baselines on downstream tasks. We further find that the concatenation of the invariant and varying spaces performs best across all tasks we investigate, including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and few-shot downstream classification tasks, and various data corruptions.},

In this paper, we provide several mathematical results needed for studying the linear regions of CNNs, and use them to derive the maximal and average numbers of linear regions for one-layer ReLU CNNs. Furthermore, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the number of linear regions of multi-layer ReLU CNNs. Our results suggest that deeper CNNs have more powerful expressivity than their shallow counterparts, while CNNs have more expressivity than fully-connected NNs per parameter.},

Existing approaches to enable such learning in artificial neural networks usually rely on network growth, importance based weight update or replay of old data from the memory. In contrast, we propose a novel approach where a neural network learns new tasks by taking gradient steps in the orthogonal direction to the gradient subspaces deemed important for the past tasks. We find the bases of these subspaces by analyzing network representations (activations) after learning each task with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in a single shot manner and store them in the memory as Gradient Projection Memory (GPM). With qualitative and quantitative analyses, we show that such orthogonal gradient decent induces minimum to no interference with the past tasks, thereby mitigating forgetting. We evaluate our algorithm on diverse image classification datasets with short and long sequences of tasks and report better or on-par performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {In this paper we report the optical properties of fluorescein-conjugated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in solid phantoms using diffusion reflection (DR) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The GNPs attached with fluorescein in solution were studied by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The intensity decays were recorded to reveal the fluorescence lifetime of fluorescein while in the near-field vicinity of the GNPs. The DR method was used to explore the solid phantoms containing GNPs, indicating the light propagation from the surface of solid phantoms. The resulting DR slopes of the reflected intensity showed the higher the GNP concentration, the bigger the slope. Fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and anisotropy images of solid phantoms were investigated by FLIM. The exploration of optical properties and molecular imaging combined with DR and FLIM methods is a new approach that has not been established until now. The combined DRâFLIM technique is expected to provide discrimination based on...},

Motivated by use-cases in personalized federated learning, we study the often overlooked aspect of the modern meta-learning algorithms -- their data efficiency. To shed more light on which methods are more efficient, we use techniques from algorithmic stability to derive bounds on the transfer risk that have important practical implications, indicating how much supervision is needed and how it must be allocated for each method to attain the desired level of generalization. Further, we introduce a new simple framework for evaluating meta-learning methods under a limit on the available supervision, conduct an empirical study of MAML, Reptile, and Protonets, and demonstrate the differences in the behavior of these methods on few-shot and federated learning benchmarks. Finally, we propose active meta-learning, which incorporates active data selection into learning-to-learn, leading to better performance of all methods in the limited supervision regime.},

abstract = {Interacting with a complex world involves continual learning, in which tasks and data distributions change over time. A continual learning system should demonstrate both plasticity (acquisition of new knowledge) and stability (preservation of old knowledge). Catastrophic forgetting is the failure of stability, in which new experience overwrites previous experience. In the brain, replay of past experience is widely believed to reduce forgetting, yet it has been largely overlooked as a solution to forgetting in deep reinforcement learning. Here, we introduce CLEAR, a replay-based method that greatly reduces catastrophic forgetting in multi-task reinforcement learning. CLEAR leverages off-policy learning and behavioral cloning from replay to enhance stability, as well as on-policy learning to preserve plasticity. We show that CLEAR performs better than state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for mitigating forgetting, despite being significantly less complicated and not requiring any knowledge of the individual tasks being learned.},

abstract = {Korf, Reid and Edelkamp initiated a line of research for developing methods (KRE and later CDP) that predict the number of nodes expanded by IDA* for a given start state and cost bound. Independently, Chen developed a method (SS) that can also be used to predict the number of nodes expanded by IDA*. In this paper we improve both of these prediction methods. First, we present {\"{I}}$\mu$-truncation, a method that acts as a preprocessing step and improves CDP{\^{E}}s prediction accuracy. Second and orthogonally to {\"{I}}$\mu$- truncation, we present a variant of CDP that can be orders of magnitude faster than CDP while producing exactly the same predictions. Third, we show how ideas developed in the KRE line of research can be used to improve the predictions produced by SS. Finally, we make an empirical comparison between our new enhanced versions of CDP and SS. Our experimental results suggest that CDP is suitable for applications that require less accurate but fast predictions, while SS is suitable for applications that require more accurate predictions but can afford more computation time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was segmented to measure local current density, electrochemical surface area, and high frequency resistance (HFR) distribution in the land-channel direction at resolution of 350 $\mu$m. An in-house catalyst coated membrane of 3 mm Ã 3 mm active area was prepared to represent a small area in a larger scale cell with 1 mm land and channel widths. This design was employed to measure current density and HFR distribution at 60Â°C with several different operating conditions. Local electrical resistance was also measured separately so that local protonic resistances can be discerned from local HFR. To analyze the effect of the land-channel geometry a method was developed to quantify the sources of current distribution, such as distributions of oxygen concentration at the electrode, oxygen transport resistance, cathode catalyst layer resistance, and membrane water content. Current density distribution is strongly correlated with the distribution of membrane water content and electrode resistance in dry condition, and oxygen concentration distribution in wet condition, while in moderate condition both oxygen concentration and water content in membrane are critical to the local current density distribution. The results imply the limitation of uniform condition assumption used in a differential cell study.},

Water table depth is more or less proportionate to the rainfall occurring on the study area. Some other factors involved in it are climate change, soil characteristics and human activities. Here in this research, an attempt has been made to study the behaviour of rainfall in Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, India. The study region is one of the most agricultural favourable climatic districts with large area of cultivating lands. Unlike the other districts in Tamil Nadu, this district gets rainfall from both south west and north east monsoons. For this analysis, wavelet tool has been used. Apart from analysing it, short term forecasting has been attempted with efficient soft computing tool, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This method has been validated with the actual water table depth with respect to the rainfall. This approach applied to the data works well for short term forecasting. The performance of the model was evaluated using the regression coefficients and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) reveals the success of the working integrated model.},

abstract = {The strain-induced softening of thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (TPUs), known as the Mullins effect, arises from their multi-phase structure. We used the combination of small-and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) during in situ repeated tensile loading to elucidate the relationship between molecular architecture, nano-strain, and macro-scale mechanical properties. Insights obtained from our analysis highlight the importance of the 'fuzzy interface' between the hard and soft regions that governs the structure evolution at nanometre length scales and leads to macroscopic stiffness reduction. We propose a hierarchical Eshelby inclusion model of phase interaction mediated by the 'fuzzy interface' that accommodates the nano-strain gradient between hard and soft regions and undergoes tension-induced softening, causing the Mullins effect that becomes apparent in TPUs even at moderate tensile strains. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) elastomers are versatile polymer materials that find numerous applications due to the outstanding combination of thermal and mechanical properties. TPUs are block co-polymers that have the morphology of nano-composites consisting of hard regions embedded within contiguous soft regions, with nano-scale gradient transitions between them that are structurally accommodated by the " fuzzy interface " regions 1, 2},

abstract = {Prediction of significant wave heights (Hs) is of immense importance in ocean and coastal engineering applications. The aim of this study is to predict significant wave height values at buoy locations with the lead time of 3,6,12 and 24 hours using past observations of wind and wave parameters applying Artificial Neural Network. Although there exists a number of wave height estimation models, they do not consider all causative factors without any approximation and consequently their results are more or less a general approximation of the overall dynamic behaviour. Since soft computing techniques are totally data driven, based on the duration of the data availability they can be used for prediction. In the National data buoy program of National institute of Ocean Technology, not all the buoys have wind sensors and wave sensors and so it is attempted to apply neural network algorithms for prediction of wave heights using wind speed only as the input and then using only wave height as the input. The measurement made by the data buoy at DS3 location in Bay of Bengal (12Â°11'21"N and 90Â°43'33"E) are considered, for the period 2003 - 2004. Out of this, the data of period Jan 2003-Dec 2003 was used for training and the data for the period July 2004- Nov 2004 is used for testing. Real time wave forecasting for 3,6,12 and 24 hours were carried out for a month at the location chosen and the results show that the ANN technique proves encouraging for wave forecasting. Performance of ANN for varying inputs have been analysed and the results are discussed.},

The geometry for two-phase composites can be classified according to the connectivity of each phase (1-, 2-, or 3-dimensionally) into 10 structures. In particular, a 1-3 piezocomposite (PZT-rod/polymer-matrix composite) is considered most useful. The advantages of this composite are high coupling factors, low acoustic impedance, good matching to water or human tissue, mechanical flexibility, and broad bandwidth in combination with a low mechanical quality factor. Piezoelectric composite materials are especially useful for underwater sonar and medical diagnostic ultrasonic transducer applications. Other types of composites based on piezoelectric ceramics are also introduced in this chapter. Piezoelectric passive dampers comprise a piezoelectric ceramic particle, polymer, and a carbon black, which suppress the noise vibration more effectively than traditional rubbers. A composite with a magnetostrictive ceramic and a piezoelectric ceramic produces an intriguing product effectâthe magnetoelectric effect in which an electric field is produced in the material in response to an applied magnetic field.},

Their versatility has led to a wealth of research to broaden the range of piezoelectric materials and their potential uses. Advanced piezoelectric materials: science and technology provides a comprehensive review of these new materials, their properties, methods of manufacture and applications. After an introductory overview of the development of piezoelectric materials, Part one reviews the various types of piezoelectric material, ranging from lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezo-ceramics, relaxor ferroelectric ceramics, lead-free piezo-ceramics, quartz-based piezoelectric materials, the use of lithium niobate and lithium in piezoelectrics, single crystal piezoelectric materials, electroactive polymers (EAP) and piezoelectric composite materials. Part two discusses how to design and fabricate piezo-materials with chapters on piezo-ceramics, single crystal preparation techniques, thin film technologies, aerosol techniques and manufacturing technologies for piezoelectric transducers. The final part of the book looks at applications such as high-power piezoelectric materials and actuators as well as the performance of piezoelectric materials under stress. With its distinguished editor and international team of expert contributors Advanced piezoelectric materials: science and technology is a standard reference for all those researching piezoelectric materials and using them to develop new devices in such areas as microelectronics, optical, sound, structural and biomedical engineering.},

To do this, we leverage recent advances that have separately shown: (1) that in the wide network limit, random networks before training are Gaussian Processes governed by a kernel known as the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel, (2) that at large depths the spectrum of the NNGP kernel simplifies considerably and becomes "weakly data-dependent", and (3) that gradient descent training of wide neural networks is described by a kernel called the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) that is related to the NNGP. Here we show that in the large depth limit the spectrum of the NTK simplifies in much the same way as that of the NNGP kernel. By analyzing this spectrum, we arrive at a precise characterization of trainability and a necessary condition for generalization across a range of architectures including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In particular, we find that there are large regions of hyperparameter space where networks can only memorize the training set in the sense they reach perfect training accuracy but completely fail to generalize outside the training set, in contrast with several recent results. By comparing CNNs with-A nd without-global average pooling, we show that CNNs without average pooling have very nearly identical learning dynamics to FCNs while CNNs with pooling contain a correction that alters its generalization performance. We perform a thorough empirical investigation of these theoretical results and finding excellent agreement on real datasets.},

abstract = {An analytical decoupling control method is proposed for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) processes with multiple time delays. The desired diagonal system transfer matrix is proposed first in terms of the H2optimal performance specification, resulting in the ideal desired decoupling controller matrix derived within the framework of a unity feedback control structure. It is demonstrated that dead-time compensators must be enclosed in the decoupling controller matrix to realize absolute decoupling for MIMO processes with multiple time delays. To alleviate the difficulties associated with the implementation, the ideal desired decoupling controller matrix is transformed into a practical form using an analytical approximation approach. Correspondingly, the stability of the resultant control system is assessed, together with its robust stability in the presence of process uncertainties. An on-line tuning rule for the single adjustable parameter of each column controllers in the decoupling controller matrix is given to cope with the process unmodeled dynamics. Finally, illustrative examples are given to show the superiority of the proposed method over the recently improved decoupling control methods. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the design of type-2 fuzzy logic systems, the early applications were realized in a way that both the antecedent and consequent parameters were chosen by the designer with perhaps some inputs from some experts. Since 2000s, a huge number of papers have been published which are based on the adaptation of the parameters of type-2 fuzzy logic systems using the training data either online or offline. Consequently, the major challenge was to design these systems in an optimal way in terms of their optimal structure and their corresponding optimal parameter update rules. In this review, the state of the art of the three major classes of optimization methods are investigated: derivative-based (computational approaches), derivative-free (heuristic methods) and hybrid methods which are the fusion of both the derivative-free and derivative-based methods.},

However, traditional fine-tuning of a well-trained deep neural network on a new task will dramatically degrade performance on the old task -- a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of anchor-free object detection, which is a new trend in computer vision as it is simple, fast, and flexible. Simply adapting current incremental learning strategies fails on these anchor-free detectors due to lack of consideration of their specific model structures. To deal with the challenges of incremental learning on anchor-free object detectors, we propose a novel incremental learning paradigm called Selective and Inter-related Distillation (SID). In addition, a novel evaluation metric is proposed to better assess the performance of detectors under incremental learning conditions. By selective distilling at the proper locations and further transferring additional instance relation knowledge, our method demonstrates significant advantages on the benchmark datasets PASCAL VOC and COCO.},

abstract = {Rehearsal, seeking to remind the model by storing old knowledge in lifelong learning, is one of the most effective ways to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, i.e., biased forgetting of previous knowledge when moving to new tasks. However, the old tasks of the most previous rehearsal-based methods suffer from the unpredictable domain shift when training the new task. This is because these methods always ignore two significant factors. First, the Data Imbalance between the new task and old tasks that makes the domain of old tasks prone to shift. Second, the Task Isolation among all tasks will make the domain shift toward unpredictable directions; To address the unpredictable domain shift, in this paper, we propose Multi-Domain Multi-Task (MDMT) rehearsal to train the old tasks and new task parallelly and equally to break the isolation among tasks. Specifically, a two-level angular margin loss is proposed to encourage the intra-class/task compactness and inter-class/task discrepancy, which keeps the model from domain chaos. In addition, to further address domain shift of the old tasks, we propose an optional episodic distillation loss on the memory to anchor the knowledge for each old task. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach can effectively mitigate the unpredictable domain shift.},

The starting point is a p-value matrix with elements obtained by comparing the expected values of random fuzzy sets by means of a bootstrap test. As such, the p-value matrix can be viewed as a relational data matrix since the p-values represent a kind of similarity between random fuzzy sets. For this reason, in order to cluster random fuzzy sets, fuzzy clustering techniques for relational data can be applied. In this context, the so-called NE-FRC algorithm is considered. One of the most important advantages of the NE-FRC is that the relational data could not be derived from Euclidean distances. Some simulations are presented to show the behavior of the proposed procedure and two applications to real-life situations are also included.},

abstract = {In continual learning, the learner faces a stream of data whose distribution changes over time. Modern neural networks are known to suffer under this setting, as they quickly forget previously acquired knowledge. To address such catastrophic forgetting, many continual learning methods implement different types of experience replay, re-learning on past data stored in a small buffer known as episodic memory. In this work, we complement experience replay with a new objective that we call âanchoringâ, where the learner uses bilevel optimization to update its knowledge on the current task, while keeping intact the predictions on some anchor points of past tasks. These anchor points are learned using gradient-based optimization to maximize forgetting, which is approximated by fine-tuning the currently trained model on the episodic memory of past tasks. Experiments on several supervised learning benchmarks for continual learning demonstrate that our approach improves the standard experience replay in terms of both accuracy and forgetting metrics and for various sizes of episodic memories.},

The better catalytic activity of the aforementioned catalyst in the biodiesel reaction could be attributed to the presence of optimal number of catalytically active basic site density on its surface.

abstract = {In the conventional transesterification of fats/vegetable oils for biodiesel production, free fatty acids and water always produce negative effects, since the presence of free fatty acids and water causes soap formation, consumes catalyst and reduces catalyst effectiveness, all of which result in a low conversion. The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the effect of water on the yield of methyl esters in transesterification of triglycerides and methyl esterification of fatty acids as treated by catalyst-free supercritical methanol. The presence of water did not have a significant effect on the yield, as complete conversions were always achieved regardless of the content of water. In fact, the present of water at a certain amount could enhance the methyl esters formation. For the vegetable oil containing water, three types of reaction took place; transesterification and hydrolysis of triglycerides and methyl esterification of fatty acids proceeded simultaneously during the treatment to produce a high yield. These results were compared with those of methyl esters prepared by acid- and alkaline-catalyzed methods. The finding demonstrated that, by a supercritical methanol approach, crude vegetable oil as well as its wastes could be readily used for biodiesel fuel production in a simple preparation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We propose two methods for short term forecasting of wind direction with the aim to provide input for tactic decisions during yacht races. The wind direction measured in the past minutes is used as input and the wind direction for the next two minutes constitutes the output. The two methods are based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM), respectively. For both methods we optimise the length of the moving average that we use to pre-process the input data, the length of the input vector and, for the ANN only, the number of neurons of each layer. The forecast is evaluated by looking at the mean absolute error and at a mean effectiveness index, which assesses the percentage of times that the forecast is accurate enough to predict the correct tactical choice in a sailing yacht race. The ANN forecast based on the ensemble average of ten networks shows a larger mean absolute error and a similar mean effectiveness index than the SVM forecast. However, we showed that the ANN forecast accuracy increases significantly with the size of the ensemble. Therefore increasing the computational power, it can lead to a better forecast.},

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.},

Many continual learning (CL) methods have been proposed to overcome catastrophic forgetting which re- sults from non i.i.d data in the sequential learning of neural networks. In this paper we focus on class incremental learn- ing, a challenging CL scenario. For this scenario, generative replay is a promising strategy which generates and replays pseudo data for previous tasks to alleviate catastrophic forget- ting. However, it is hard to train a generative model continu- ally for relatively complex data. Based on recently proposed orthogonal weight modification (OWM) algorithm which can approximately keep previously learned feature invariant when learning new tasks, we propose to 1) replay penultimate layer feature with a generative model; 2) leverage a self-supervised auxiliary task to further enhance the stability of feature. Em- pirical results on several datasets show our method always achieves substantial improvement over powerful OWM while conventional generative replay always results in a negative effect. Meanwhile our method beats several strong baselines including one based on real data storage. In addition, we con- duct experiments to study why our method is effective. Introduction},

This violates the assumptions that underlie methods for training standard deep neural networks, and will cause them to suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Arguably, the best method for incremental class learning is iCaRL, but it requires storing training examples for each class, making it challenging to scale. Here, we propose FearNet for incremental class learning. FearNet is a generative model that does not store previous examples, making it memory efficient. FearNet uses a brain-inspired dual-memory system in which new memories are consolidated from a network for recent memories inspired by the mammalian hippocampal complex to a network for long-term storage inspired by medial prefrontal cortex. Memory consolidation is inspired by mechanisms that occur during sleep. FearNet also uses a module inspired by the basolateral amygdala for determining which memory system to use for recall. FearNet achieves state-of-the-art performance at incremental class learning on image \(CIFAR-100, CUB-200\) and audio classification \(AudioSet\) benchmarks.},

In this paper, we look into AAM fitting algorithms and make the following orthogonal contributions: We present a simple " project-out " optimization framework that unifies and revises the most well-known optimization problems and solutions in AAMs. Based on this framework, we describe robust simul-taneous AAM fitting algorithms the complexity of which is not prohibitive for current systems. We then go on one step further and propose a new approximate project-out AAM fit-ting algorithm which we coin Extended Project-Out Inverse Compositional (E-POIC). In contrast to current algorithms, E-POIC is both efficient and robust. Next, we describe a part-based AAM employing a translational motion model, which results in superior fitting and convergence proper-ties. We also show that the proposed AAMs, when trained " in-the-wild " using SIFT descriptors, perform surprisingly well even for the case of unseen unconstrained images. Via a number of experiments on unconstrained human and ani-mal face databases, we show that our combined contributions largely bridge the gap between exact and current approximate methods for AAM fitting and perform comparably with state-of-the-art face alignment systems.},

Recent research in active learning has mostly focused on the simple image classification task. In this paper, we propose novel methods to estimate sample uncertainties for 2D and 3D object detection using Ensembles. We moreover evaluate different training strategies including Continuous Training to alleviate increasing training times introduced by the active learning cycle. Finally, we investigate the effects of active learning on imbalanced datasets and possible interactions with class weighting. Experiment results show both increased time saving around 55% and data saving rates of around 30%. For the 3D object detection task, we show that our proposed uncertainty estimation method is valid, saving 35% of labeling efforts and thus is ready for application for automotive object detection use cases.},

Modeling physics system, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difficult to train for a fixed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

abstract = {Person re-identification is a useful technique to automatically match observations of the same person cross different times and different camera views. It attracts extensive attention and researches in computer vision community because of its application and challenge. An effect way to tackle the problem is to learn a useful distance metric from training examples. Then the learned metric could be used for distance calculations between a probe image and images from the gallery. For a real application, the labeled training samples usually increase gradually along the time. To keep the performance of a system for re-identification tasks, the learned model needs to be updated according to the newly added training sets. Although the learned model can be retrained with the whole dataset, the procedure is usually time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an incremental metric learning method based on the widely used XQDA metric for person re-identification. The key idea is that the covariance matrices of similar and dissimilar example pairs can be effectively updated incrementally in the XQDA metric learning algorithm. Then the final metric could be deduced in an incremental way. The proposed approach method is validated on two public available datasets, and the experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

Previous works report mixed empirical results when extrapolating with neural networks: while multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) do not extrapolate well in certain simple tasks, Graph Neural Network (GNN), a structured network with MLP modules, has shown some success in more complex tasks. Working towards a theoretical explanation, we identify conditions under which MLPs and GNNs extrapolate well. First, we quantify the observation that ReLU MLPs quickly converge to linear functions along any direction from the origin, which implies that ReLU MLPs do not extrapolate most non-linear functions. But, they can provably learn a linear target function when the training distribution is sufficiently âdiverseâ. Second, in connection to analyzing successes and limitations of GNNs, these results suggest a hypothesis for which we provide theoretical and empirical evidence: the success of GNNs in extrapolating algorithmic tasks to new data (e.g., larger graphs or edge weights) relies on encoding task-specific non-linearities in the architecture or features.},

abstract = {Weight decay (WD) is a traditional regularization technique in deep learning, but despite its ubiquity, its behavior is still an area of active research. Golatkar et al. have recently shown that WD only matters at the start of the training in computer vision, upending traditional wisdom. Loshchilov et al. show that for adaptive optimizers, manually decaying weights can outperform adding an $l_2$ penalty to the loss. This technique has become increasingly popular and is referred to as decoupled WD. The goal of this paper is to investigate these two recent empirical observations. We demonstrate that by applying WD only at the start, the network norm stays small throughout training. This has a regularizing effect as the effective gradient updates become larger. However, traditional generalizations metrics fail to capture this effect of WD, and we show how a simple scale-invariant metric can. We also show how the growth of network weights is heavily influenced by the dataset and its generalization properties. For decoupled WD, we perform experiments in NLP and RL where adaptive optimizers are the norm. We demonstrate that the primary issue that decoupled WD alleviates is the mixing of gradients from the objective function and the $l_2$ penalty in the buffers of Adam (which stores the estimates of the first-order moment). Adaptivity itself is not problematic and decoupled WD ensures that the gradients from the $l_2$ term cannot "drown out" the true objective, facilitating easier hyperparameter tuning.},

However, recent approaches like BYOL and SimSiam, show remarkable performance {\it without} negative pairs, raising a fundamental theoretical question: how can SSL with only positive pairs avoid representational collapse? We study the nonlinear learning dynamics of non-contrastive SSL in simple linear networks. Our analysis yields conceptual insights into how non-contrastive SSL methods learn, how they avoid representational collapse, and how multiple factors, like predictor networks, stop-gradients, exponential moving averages, and weight decay all come into play. Our simple theory recapitulates the results of real-world ablation studies in both STL-10 and ImageNet. Furthermore, motivated by our theory we propose a novel approach that \emph{directly} sets the predictor based on the statistics of its inputs. In the case of linear predictors, our approach outperforms gradient training of the predictor by $5\%$ and on ImageNet it performs comparably with more complex two-layer non-linear predictors that employ BatchNorm.

The representation contains complementary information to that learned from supervised image datasets like ImageNet. Qualitative results show that our method captures information that is temporally varying, such as human pose.When used as pre-training for action recognition, our method gives significant gains over learning without external data on benchmark datasets like UCF101 and HMDB51. To demonstrate its sensitivity to human pose, we show results for pose estimation on the FLIC and MPII datasets that are competitive, or better than approaches using significantly more supervision. Our method can be combined with supervised representations to provide an additional boost in accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a principled approach for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in deep neural networks (DNN). Modeling probability distributions on deep features has recently emerged as an effective, yet computationally cheap method to detect OOD samples in DNN. However, the features produced by a DNN at any given layer do not fully occupy the corresponding high-dimensional feature space. We apply linear statistical dimensionality reduction techniques and nonlinear manifold-learning techniques on the high-dimensional features in order to capture the true subspace spanned by the features. We hypothesize that such lower-dimensional feature embeddings can mitigate the curse of dimensionality, and enhance any feature-based method for more efficient and effective performance. In the context of uncertainty estimation and OOD, we show that the log-likelihood score obtained from the distributions learnt on this lower-dimensional subspace is more discriminative for OOD detection. We also show that the feature reconstruction error, which is the $L_2$-norm of the difference between the original feature and the pre-image of its embedding, is highly effective for OOD detection and in some cases superior to the log-likelihood scores. The benefits of our approach are demonstrated on image features by detecting OOD images, using popular DNN architectures on commonly used image datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN.},

In this paper, we discussed and demonstrated three principled missing data methods: multiple imputation, full information maximum likelihood, and expectation-maximization algorithm, applied to a real-world data set. Results were contrasted with those obtained from the complete data set and from the listwise deletion method. The relative merits of each method are noted, along with common features they share. The paper concludes with an emphasis on the importance of statistical assumptions, and recommendations for researchers. Quality of research will be enhanced if (a) researchers explicitly acknowledge missing data problems and the conditions under which they occurred, (b) principled methods are employed to handle missing data, and (c) the appropriate treatment of missing data is incorporated into review standards of manuscripts submitted for publication.},

Inspired by cognitive and linguistic evidence showing that the use of these expressions relies on setting a threshold that is dependent on a specific context, we investigate the ability of multi-modal models in assessing whether an object is 'big' or 'small' in a given visual scene. In contrast with the standard computational approach that simplistically treats gradable adjectives as 'fixed' attributes, we pose the problem as relational: to be successful, a model has to consider the full visual context. By means of four main tasks, we show that state-of-the-art models (but not a relatively strong baseline) can learn the function subtending the meaning of size adjectives, though their performance is found to decrease while moving from simple to more complex tasks. Crucially, models fail in developing abstract representations of gradable adjectives that can be used compositionally.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new lifelong learning solution where a single model is trained for a sequence of tasks. The main challenge that vision systems face in this context is catastrophic forgetting: as they tend to adapt to the most recently seen task, they lose performance on the tasks that were learned previously. Our method aims at preserving the knowledge of the previous tasks while learning a new one by using autoencoders. For each task, an under-complete autoencoder is learned, capturing the features that are crucial for its achievement. When a new task is presented to the system, we prevent the reconstructions of the features with these autoencoders from changing, which has the effect of preserving the information on which the previous tasks are mainly relying. At the same time, the features are given space to adjust to the most recent environment as only their projection into a low dimension submanifold is controlled. The proposed system is evaluated on image classification tasks and shows a reduction of forgetting over the state-of-the-art.},

However, the images of different fine-grained objects tend to merely exhibit subtle differences in appearance, which will severely deteriorate zero-shot object recognition. To reduce the superfluous information in the fine-grained objects, in this paper, we propose to learn the redundancy-free features for generalized zero-shot learning. We achieve our motivation by projecting the original visual features into a new (redundancy-free) feature space and then restricting the statistical dependence between these two feature spaces. Furthermore, we require the projected features to keep and even strengthen the category relationship in the redundancy-free feature space. In this way, we can remove the redundant information from the visual features without losing the discriminative information. We extensively evaluate the performance on four benchmark datasets. The results show that our redundancy-free feature based generalized zero-shot learning (RFF-GZSL) approach can outperform the state-of-the-arts often by a large margin. Our code is available.},

abstract = {The challenge of unsupervised person re-identification (ReID) lies in learning discriminative features without true labels. This paper formulates unsupervised person ReID as a multi-label classification task to progressively seek true labels. Our method starts by assigning each person image with a single-class label, then evolves to multi-label classification by leveraging the updated ReID model for label prediction. The label prediction comprises similarity computation and cycle consistency to ensure the quality of predicted labels. To boost the ReID model training efficiency in multi-label classification, we further propose the memory-based multi-label classification loss (MMCL). MMCL works with memory-based non-parametric classifier and integrates multi-label classification and single-label classification in a unified framework. Our label prediction and MMCL work iteratively and substantially boost the ReID performance. Experiments on several large-scale person ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in unsupervised person ReID. Our method also allows to use labeled person images in other domains. Under this transfer learning setting, our method also achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.},

abstract = {Neural networks trained on visual data are well-known to be vulnerable to often imperceptible adversarial perturbations. The reasons for this vulnerability are still being debated in the literature. Recently Ilyas et al. (2019) showed that this vulnerability arises, in part, because neural network classifiers rely on highly predictive but brittle "non-robust" features. In this paper we extend the work of Ilyas et al. by investigating the nature of the input patterns that give rise to these features. In particular, we hypothesize that in a neural network trained in a standard way, non-robust features respond to small, "non-semantic" patterns that are typically entangled with larger, robust patterns, known to be more human-interpretable, as opposed to solely responding to statistical artifacts in a dataset. Thus, adversarial examples can be formed via minimal perturbations to these small, entangled patterns. In addition, we demonstrate a corollary of our hypothesis: robust classifiers are more effective than standard (non-robust) ones as a source for generating transferable adversarial examples in both the untargeted and targeted settings. The results we present in this paper provide new insight into the nature of the non-robust features responsible for adversarial vulnerability of neural network classifiers.},

Before forecasting the solar systems output, it is essential to focus the prediction on the solar irradiance. The global solar radiation forecasting can be performed by several methods; the two big categories are the cloud imagery combined with physical models, and the machine learning models. In this context, the objective of this paper is to give an overview of forecasting methods of solar irradiation using machine learning approaches. Although, a lot of papers describes methodologies like neural networks or support vector regression, it will be shown that other methods (regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting and many others) begin to be used in this context of prediction. The performance ranking of such methods is complicated due to the diversity of the data set, time step, forecasting horizon, set up and performance indicators. Overall, the error of prediction is quite equivalent. To improve the prediction performance some authors proposed the use of hybrid models or to use an ensemble forecast approach.},

The model describes the performance of non-precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in a fuel cell context. Because of its relatively high thickness, emphasis is placed on phenomena occurring in the cathode layer. Water flooding is studied in terms of its impact on gas-phase transport and on electrochemically accessible surface area (ECSA). Although cathode performance in both air and oxygen are susceptible to ECSA loss, gas diffusion limitations at high current density in air are more significant. In oxygen, catalyst utilization at high current density is primarily limited by conductivity. For this reason, air fuel cell data is recommended over oxygen data for characterizing catalyst performance. Due to both ohmic and mass transport limitations, increased loading of low-cost catalysts does not necessarily lead to higher performance. Therefore, careful optimization of catalyst layer thickness is required.},

abstract = {In class-incremental learning, a learning agent faces a stream of data with the goal of learning new classes while not forgetting previous ones. Neural networks are known to suffer under this setting, as they forget previously acquired knowledge. To address this problem, effective methods exploit past data stored in an episodic memory while expanding the final classifier nodes to accommodate the new classes. In this work, we substitute the expanding classifier with a novel fixed classifier in which a number of pre-allocated output nodes are subject to the classification loss right from the beginning of the learning phase. Contrarily to the standard expanding classifier, this allows: (a) the output nodes of future unseen classes to firstly see negative samples since the beginning of learning together with the positive samples that incrementally arrive; (b) to learn features that do not change their geometric configuration as novel classes are incorporated in the learning model. Experiments with public datasets show that the proposed approach is as effective as the expanding classifier while exhibiting novel intriguing properties of the internal feature representation that are otherwise not-existent. Our ablation study on pre-allocating a large number of classes further validates the approach.},

abstract = {Service robots can help with many of our daily tasks, especially in those cases where it is inconvenient or unsafe for us to intervene: e.g., under extreme weather conditions or when social distance needs to be maintained. However, before we can successfully delegate complex tasks to robots, we need to enhance their ability to make sense of dynamic, real world environments. In this context, the first prerequisite to improving the Visual Intelligence of a robot is building robust and reliable object recognition systems. While object recognition solutions are traditionally based on Machine Learning methods, augmenting them with knowledge based reasoners has been shown to improve their performance. In particular, based on our prior work on identifying the epistemic requirements of Visual Intelligence, we hypothesise that knowledge of the typical size of objects could significantly improve the accuracy of an object recognition system. To verify this hypothesis, in this paper we present an approach to integrating knowledge about object sizes in a ML based architecture. Our experiments in a real world robotic scenario show that this combined approach ensures a significant performance increase over state of the art Machine Learning methods.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have liberated its extraordinary power on various tasks. However, it is still very challenging to deploy state-of-the-art models into real-world applications due to their high computational complexity. How can we design a compact and effective network without massive experiments and expert knowledge? In this paper, we propose a simple and effective framework to learn and prune deep models in an end-to-end manner. In our framework, a new type of parameter â scaling factor is first introduced to scale the outputs of specific structures, such as neurons, groups or residual blocks. Then we add sparsity regularizations on these factors, and solve this optimization problem by a modified stochastic Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method. By forcing some of the factors to zero, we can safely remove the corresponding structures, thus prune the unimportant parts of a CNN. Comparing with other structure selection methods that may need thousands of trials or iterative fine-tuning, our method is trained fully end-to-end in one training pass without bells and whistles. We evaluate our method, Sparse Structure Selection with several state-of-the-art CNNs, and demonstrate very promising results with adaptive depth and width selection.

abstract = {Are neural networks biased toward simple functions? Does depth always help learn more complex features? Is training the last layer of a network as good as training all layers? These questions seem unrelated at face value, but in this work we give all of them a common treatment from the spectral perspective. We will study the spectra of the Conjugate Kernel, CK, (also called the Neural Network-Gaussian Process Kernel), and the Neural Tangent Kernel, NTK. Roughly, the CK and the NTK tell us respectively âwhat a network looks like at initializationâ and âwhat a network looks like during and after training.â Their spectra then encode valuable information about the initial distribution and the training and generalization properties of neural networks. By analyzing the eigenvalues, we lend novel insights into the questions put forth at the beginning, and we verify these insights by extensive experiments of neural networks. We believe the computational tools we develop here for analyzing the spectra of CK and NTK serve as a solid foundation for future studies of deep neural networks. We have open-sourced the code for it and for generating the plots in this paper at github.com/thegregyang/NNspectra.},

Typical instances of hourglass networks contain shortcut connections between mirroring layers. These shortcut connections improve the performance and it is hypothesized that this is due to mitigating effects on the vanishing gradient problem and the ability of the model to combine feature maps from earlier and later layers. We propose a method for not only combining feature maps of mirroring layers but also feature maps of layers with different spatial dimensions. For instance, the method enables the integration of the bottleneck feature map with those of the reconstruction layers. The proposed approach is applicable to any hourglass architecture. We evaluated the contextual hourglass networks on image segmentation and object counting problems in the medical domain. We achieve competitive results outperforming popular hourglass networks by up to 17 percentage points.},

This paper reviews the data available for the study of climate and weather patterns in Australia. A list of global reanalysis and satellite data is provided, along with a more detailed review of available in situ (weather station) data in Australia. Regularly updated climate indices are identified that have previously been linked to Australian climate and weather events. Observation of Australian weather is severely hampered by the continents' vastness and remoteness, as evidenced by heavy bias of in situ measurements that are generally clustered in the coastal high-population centres (mainly southeast of Australia), with central and northern regions often having to rely on remote sensing and reanalysis data. Data sparsity can introduce significant uncertainty in terms of extreme weather and climate change management, as variables such as rainfall exhibit high spatial and temporal variability. Several areas for future research are identified, including investigation into the impact of Australian aerosol levels, the connection between soil moisture and flooding potential, and teleconnection between Atlantic sea surface temperature and Australian climate. While this study focusses on data availability to investigate Australian climate patterns, findings are applicable at a global scale.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Lean construction results from the application of a new form of production management to construction. Essential features of lean construction include a clear set of objectives for the delivery process, aimed at maximizing performance for the customer at the project level, concurrent design, construction, and the application of project control throughout the life cycle of the project from design to delivery. An increasing number of construction academics and professionals have been storming the ramparts of conventional construction management in an effort to deliver better value to owners while making real profits. As a result, lean-based tools have emerged and have been successfully applied to simple and complex construction projects. In general, lean construction projects are easier to manage, safer, completed sooner, and cost less and are of better quality. Significant research remains to complete the translation to construction of lean thinking in Egypt. This research will discuss principles, methods, and implementation phases of lean construction showing the waste in construction and how it could be minimized. The Last Planner System technique, which is an important application of the lean construction concepts and methodologies and is more prevalent, proved that it could enhance the construction management practices in various aspects. Also, it is intended to develop methodology for process evaluation and define areas for improvement based on lean approach principles. {\textcopyright} 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Deep learning algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input distribution in order to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of lower-level features. The objective is to make these higher- level representations more abstract, with their individual features more invariant to most of the variations that are typically present in the training distribution, while collectively preserving as much as possible of the information in the input. Ideally, we would like these representations to disentangle the unknown factors of variation that underlie the training distribution. Such unsupervised learning of representations can be exploited usefully under the hypothesis that the input distribution P(x) is structurally related to some task of interest, say predicting P(y|x). This paper focusses on why unsupervised pre-training of representations can be useful, and how it can be exploited in the transfer learning scenario, where we care about predictions on examples that are not from the same distribution as the training distribution},

abstract = {We propose a new formulation for pruning convolutional kernels in neural networks to enable efficient inference. We interleave greedy criteria-based pruning with fine-tuning by backpropagation-a computationally efficient procedure that maintains good generalization in the pruned network. We propose a new criterion based on Taylor expansion that approximates the change in the cost function induced by pruning network parameters. We focus on transfer learning, where large pretrained networks are adapted to specialized tasks. The proposed criterion demonstrates superior performance compared to other criteria, e.g. the norm of kernel weights or feature map activation, for pruning large CNNs after adaptation to fine-grained classification tasks (Birds-200 and Flowers-102) relaying only on the first order gradient information. We also show that pruning can lead to more than 10Ã theoretical reduction in adapted 3D-convolutional filters with a small drop in accuracy in a recurrent gesture classifier. Finally, we show results for the large-scale ImageNet dataset to emphasize the flexibility of our approach.},

abstract = {We have witnessed rapid evolution of deep neural network architecture design in the past years. These latest progresses greatly facilitate the developments in various areas such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, along with the extraordinary performance, these state-of-the-art models also bring in expensive computational cost. Directly deploying these models into applications with real-time requirement is still infeasible. Recently, Hinton et al. (?) have shown that the dark knowledge within a powerful teacher model can significantly help the training of a smaller and faster student network. These knowledge are vastly beneficial to improve the generalization ability of the student model. Inspired by their work, we introduce a new type of knowledge - cross sample similarities for model compression and acceleration. This knowledge can be naturally derived from deep metric learning model. To transfer them, we bring the âlearning to rankâ technique into deep metric learning formulation. We test our proposed DarkRank method on various metric learning tasks including pedestrian re-identification, image retrieval and image clustering. The results are quite encouraging. Our method can improve over the baseline method by a large margin. Moreover, it is fully compatible with other existing methods. When combined, the performance can be further boosted.},

De-blurring is achieved based on the dynamic-based approach, which is used to estimate the Point Spread Function (PSF) during the camera exposure window. The deconvolution process involving iterative matrix calculations of pixels, is then performed on the GPU to decrease the time cost. Compared to the Gauss method and the LucyâRichardson method, it has the best result of the image restoration. The proposed method has been evaluated by using the Hopkinson bar loading system. In comparison to the blurry image, the proposed method has successfully restored the image. It is also demonstrated from image processing applications that the de-blurring method can improve the accuracy and the stability of the digital imaging correlation measurement.},

abstract = {Artificial autonomous agents and robots interacting in complex environments are required to continually acquire and fine-tune knowledge over sustained periods of time. The ability to learn from continuous streams of information is referred to as lifelong learning and represents a long-standing challenge for neural network models due to catastrophic forgetting in which novel sensory experience interferes with existing representations and leads to abrupt decreases in the performance on previously acquired knowledge. Computational models of lifelong learning typically alleviate catastrophic forgetting in experimental scenarios with given datasets of static images and limited complexity, thereby differing significantly from the conditions artificial agents are exposed to. In more natural settings, sequential information may become progressively available over time and access to previous experience may be restricted. Therefore, specialized neural network mechanisms are required that adapt to novel sequential experience while preventing disruptive interference with existing representations. In this paper, we propose a dual-memory self-organizing architecture for lifelong learning scenarios. The architecture comprises two growing recurrent networks with the complementary tasks of learning object instances (episodic memory) and categories (semantic memory). Both growing networks can expand in response to novel sensory experience: the episodic memory learns fine-grained spatiotemporal representations of object instances in an unsupervised fashion while the semantic memory uses task-relevant signals to regulate structural plasticity levels and develop more compact representations from episodic experience. For the consolidation of knowledge in the absence of external sensory input, the episodic memory periodically replays trajectories of neural reactivations. We evaluate the proposed model on the CORe50 benchmark dataset for continuous object recognition, showing that we significantly outperform current methods of lifelong learning in three different incremental learning scenarios.},

The proposed method considers both packet importance as well as delay constraints. One of the advantages of a fuzzy controller is the fact that, regardless of the design complexity, it can be implemented as a simple look-up table. This makes it ideal for high-speed optical switches. We have used two fuzzy controllers: one to select a packet to be forwarded to an output port and another to decide which packet(s) should be buffered or dropped. In a simulation example, video traffic with three priority classes is considered. The results show up to 3 dBs of improvement in the quality of the received video, resulting from the packet loss differentiation achieved by employing the proposed fuzzy packet scheduling approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 Optical Society of America.},

The main purpose is to accelerate the training of a significantly larger neural net. During real-world workflows, one often trains very many different neural networks during the experimentation and design process. This is a wasteful process in which each new model is trained from scratch. Our Net2Net technique accelerates the experimentation process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge from a previous network to each new deeper or wider network. Our techniques are based on the concept of function-preserving transformations between neural network specifications. This differs from previous approaches to pre-training that altered the function represented by a neural net when adding layers to it. Using our knowledge transfer mechanism to add depth to Inception modules, we demonstrate a new state of the art accuracy rating on the ImageNet dataset.},

abstract = {A standard practice of deploying deep neural networks is to apply the same architecture to all the input instances. However, a fixed architecture may not be suitable for different data with high diversity. To boost the model capacity , existing methods usually employ larger convolutional kernels or deeper network layers, which incurs prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing Differentiable Dynamic Wirings (DDW), which learns the instance-aware connectivity that creates different wiring patterns for different instances. 1) Specifically, the network is initialized as a complete directed acyclic graph, where the nodes represent convolutional blocks and the edges represent the connection paths. 2) We generate edge weights by a learnable module, Router, and select the edges whose weights are larger than a threshold, to adjust the connectivity of the neural network structure. 3) Instead of using the same path of the network, DDW aggregates features dynamically in each node, which allows the network to have more representation power. To facilitate effective training, we further represent the network connectivity of each sample as an adjacency matrix. The matrix is updated to aggregate features in the forward pass, cached in the memory, and used for gradient computing in the backward pass. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with several mainstream architectures, including MobileNetV2, ResNet, ResNeXt, and RegNet. Extensive experiments are performed on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of our approach.},

abstract = {One paradigm for learning from few labeled examples while making best use of a large amount of unlabeled data is unsupervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning. Although this paradigm uses unlabeled data in a task-agnostic way, in contrast to most previous approaches to semi-supervised learning for computer vision, we show that it is surprisingly effective for semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A key ingredient of our approach is the use of a big (deep and wide) network during pretraining and fine-tuning. We find that, the fewer the labels, the more this approach (task-agnostic use of unlabeled data) benefits from a bigger network. After fine-tuning, the big network can be further improved and distilled into a much smaller one with little loss in classification accuracy by using the unlabeled examples for a second time, but in a task-specific way. The proposed semi-supervised learning algorithm can be summarized in three steps: unsupervised pretraining of a big ResNet model using SimCLRv2 (a modification of SimCLR [1]), supervised fine-tuning on a few labeled examples, and distillation with unlabeled examples for refining and transferring the task-specific knowledge. This procedure achieves 73.9% ImageNet top-1 accuracy with just 1% of the labels (â¤13 labeled images per class) using ResNet-50, a 10Ã improvement in label efficiency over the previous state-of-the-art. With 10% of labels, ResNet-50 trained with our method achieves 77.5% top-1 accuracy, outperforming standard supervised training with all of the labels. 1},

abstract = {The continual learning problem involves training models with limited capacity to perform well on a set of an unknown number of sequentially arriving tasks. While meta-learning shows great potential for reducing interference between old and new tasks, the current training procedures tend to be either slow or offline, and sensitive to many hyper-parameters. In this work, we propose Look-ahead MAML (La-MAML), a fast optimisation-based meta-learning algorithm for online-continual learning, aided by a small episodic memory. Our proposed modulation of per-parameter learning rates in our meta-learning update allows us to draw connections to prior work on hypergradients and meta-descent. This provides a more flexible and efficient way to mitigate catastrophic forgetting compared to conventional prior-based methods. La-MAML achieves performance superior to other replay-based, prior-based and meta-learning based approaches for continual learning on real-world visual classification benchmarks.},

abstract = {The Backprop algorithm for learning in neural networks utilizes two mechanisms: first, stochastic gradient descent and second, initialization with small random weights, where the latter is essential to the effectiveness of the former. We show that in continual learning setups, Backprop performs well initially, but over time its performance degrades. Stochastic gradient descent alone is insufficient to learn continually; the initial randomness enables only initial learning but not continual learning. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first result showing this degradation in Backprop's ability to learn. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm that continually injects random features alongside gradient descent using a new generate-and-test process. We call this the Continual Backprop algorithm. We show that, unlike Backprop, Continual Backprop is able to continually adapt in both supervised and reinforcement learning problems. We expect that as continual learning becomes more common in future applications, a method like Continual Backprop will be essential where the advantages of random initialization are present throughout learning.},

abstract = {The Non-Local Network (NLNet) presents a pioneering approach for capturing long-range dependencies within an image, via aggregating query-specific global context to each query position. However, through a rigorous empirical analysis, we have found that the global contexts modeled by the non-local network are almost the same for different query positions. In this paper, we take advantage of this finding to create a simplified network based on a query-independent formulation, which maintains the accuracy of NLNet but with significantly less computation. We further replace the one-layer transformation function of the non-local block by a two-layer bottleneck, which further reduces the parameter number considerably. The resulting network element, called the global context (GC) block, effectively models global context in a lightweight manner, allowing it to be applied at multiple layers of a backbone network to form a global context network (GCNet). Experiments show that GCNet generally outperforms NLNet on major benchmarks for various recognition tasks. The code and network configurations are available at https://github.com/xvjiarui/GCNet.},

abstract = {Contrastive learning is an effective method for learning visual representations. In most cases, this involves adding an explicit loss function to encourage similar images to have similar representations, and different images to have different representations. Inspired by contrastive learning, we introduce a clever input construction for Implicit Contrastive Learning (ImCLR), primarily in the supervised setting: there, the network can implicitly learn to differentiate between similar and dissimilar images. Each input is presented as a concatenation of two images, and the label is the mean of the two one-hot labels. Furthermore, this requires almost no change to existing pipelines, which allows for easy integration and for fair demonstration of effectiveness on a wide range of well-accepted benchmarks. Namely, there is no change to loss, no change to hyperparameters, and no change to general network architecture. We show that ImCLR improves the test error in the supervised setting across a variety of settings, including 3.24% on Tiny ImageNet, 1.30% on CIFAR-100, 0.14% on CIFAR-10, and 2.28% on STL-10. We show that this holds across different number of labeled samples, maintaining approximately a 2% gap in test accuracy down to using only 5% of the whole dataset. We further show that gains hold for robustness to common input corruptions and perturbations at varying severities with a 0.72% improvement on CIFAR-100-C, and in the semi-supervised setting with a 2.16% improvement with the standard benchmark $\Pi$-model. We demonstrate that ImCLR is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, achieving over 1% improvement on CIFAR-100 and 2% improvement on Tiny ImageNet by combining ImCLR with CutMix over either baseline, and 2% by combining ImCLR with AutoAugment over either baseline.},

In particular, we show the general feasibility of training Neural Networks whose parameters are constrained by a convex feasible region using Frank-Wolfe algorithms and compare different stochastic variants. We then show that, by choosing an appropriate region, one can achieve performance exceeding that of unconstrained stochastic Gradient Descent and matching state-of-the-art results relying on $L^2$-regularization.

abstract = {Efficient gradient computation of the Jacobian determinant term is a core problem of the normalizing flow framework. Thus, most proposed flow models either restrict to a function class with easy evaluation of the Jacobian determinant, or an efficient estimator thereof. However, these restrictions limit the performance of such density models, frequently requiring significant depth to reach desired performance levels. In this work, we propose Self Normalizing Flows, a flexible framework for training normalizing flows by replacing expensive terms in the gradient by learned approximate inverses at each layer. This reduces the computational complexity of each layer's exact update from $\mathcal{O}(D^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(D^2)$, allowing for the training of flow architectures which were otherwise computationally infeasible, while also providing efficient sampling. We show experimentally that such models are remarkably stable and optimize to similar data likelihood values as their exact gradient counterparts, while surpassing the performance of their functionally constrained counterparts.},

abstract = {As a challenging problem in machine learning, few-shot class-incremental learning asynchronously learns a sequence of tasks, acquiring the new knowledge from new tasks (with limited new samples) while keeping the learned knowledge from previous tasks (with old samples discarded). In general, existing approaches resort to one unified feature space for balancing old-knowledge preserving and new-knowledge adaptation. With a limited embedding capacity of feature representation, the unified feature space often makes the learner suffer from semantic drift or overfitting as the number of tasks increases. With this motivation, we propose a novel few-shot class-incremental learning pipeline based on a composite representation space, which makes old-knowledge preserving and new-knowledge adaptation mutually compatible by feature space composition (enlarging the embedding capacity). The composite representation space is generated by integrating two space components (i.e. stable base knowledge space and dynamic lifelong-learning knowledge space) in terms of distance metric construction. With the composite feature space, our method performs remarkably well on the CUB200 and CIFAR100 datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithms by 10.58% and 14.65% respectively.},

Von Tunzelmann assessed the quantitative impact of the Watt steam engine and its pirate copies on the British economy using the social savings method pioneered by R.W. Fogel, showing that the impact was smaller and later than many historians had supposed. These results are of more than quantitative significance because they call into question a dominant line in the history of industrialization that focuses on the steam engine as a key determinant of the dynamics of industrial growth in Britain from the late eighteenth century. This article discusses the origin of this line in the work of Arnold Toynbee and outlines its long-term influence on economic history, including contemporary debates on the question of why Europe outpaced China and India from the seventeenth century. These issues are important also for innovation studies, which often describes the relation between innovation and growth in terms of such 'critical technologies' as steam power; these accounts are subject to the same weaknesses as technicist histories of industrialization. Von Tunzelmann's early work is therefore of continuing theoretical and empirical significance as we seek an adequate theory of the links between innovation and growth. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Decomposing knowledge into interchangeable pieces promises a generalization advantage when there are changes in distribution. A learning agent interacting with its environment is likely to be faced with situations requiring novel combinations of existing pieces of knowledge. We hypothesize that such a decomposition of knowledge is particularly relevant for being able to generalize in a systematic way to out-of-distribution changes. To study these ideas, we propose a particular training framework in which we assume that the pieces of knowledge an agent needs, as well as its reward function are stationary and can be re-used across tasks. An attention mechanism dynamically selects which modules can be adapted to the current task, and the parameters of the selected modules are allowed to change quickly as the learner is confronted with variations in what it experiences, while the parameters of the attention mechanisms act as stable, slowly changing, meta-parameters. We focus on pieces of knowledge captured by an ensemble of modules sparsely communicating with each other via a bottleneck of attention. We find that meta-learning the modular aspects of the proposed system greatly helps in achieving faster adaptation in experiments with a reinforcement learning setup involving navigation in a partially observed grid world with image-level input. We also find that reversing the role of parameters and meta-parameters does not work nearly as well, suggesting a particular role for fast adaptation of the dynamically selected modules.},

We propose an unsupervised method for collecting quantitative information from large amounts of web data, and use it to create a new, very large resource consisting of distributions over physical quantities associ- ated with objects, adjectives, and verbs which we call Distribution over Quantities (DOQ)1. This contrasts with recent work in this area which has focused on making only relative comparisons such as âIs a lion bigger than a wolf?â. Our evaluation shows that DOQ com- pares favorably with state of the art results on existing datasets for relative comparisons of nouns and adjectives, and on a new dataset we introduce.},

The only necessary knowledge about the unseen categories comes from unsupervised large text corpora. In our zero-shot framework distributional information in language can be seen as spanning a semantic basis for understanding what objects look like. Most previous zero-shot learning models can only differentiate between unseen classes. In contrast, our model can both obtain state of the art performance on classes that have thousands of training images and obtain reasonable performance on unseen classes. This is achieved by first using outlier detection in the semantic space and then two separate recognition models. Furthermore, our model does not require any manually defined semantic features for either words or images.},

abstract = {Continual learning aims to improve the ability of modern learning systems to deal with non-stationary distributions, typically by attempting to learn a series of tasks sequentially. Prior art in the field has largely considered supervised or reinforcement learning tasks, and often assumes full knowledge of task labels and boundaries. In this work, we propose an approach (CURL) to tackle a more general problem that we will refer to as unsupervised continual learning. The focus is on learning representations without any knowledge about task identity, and we explore scenarios when there are abrupt changes between tasks, smooth transitions from one task to another, or even when the data is shuffled. The proposed approach performs task inference directly within the model, is able to dynamically expand to capture new concepts over its lifetime, and incorporates additional rehearsal-based techniques to deal with catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate the efficacy of CURL in an unsupervised learning setting with MNIST and Omniglot, where the lack of labels ensures no information is leaked about the task. Further, we demonstrate strong performance compared to prior art in an i.i.d setting, or when adapting the technique to supervised tasks such as incremental class learning.},

We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers.

abstract = {Both physical activity and exposure to nature are known separately to have positive effects on physical and mental health. We have investigated whether there is a synergistic benefit in adopting physical activities whilst being directly exposed to nature ('green exercise'). Five groups of 20 subjects were exposed to a sequence of 30 scenes projected on a wall whilst exercising on a treadmill. Four categories of scenes were tested: rural pleasant, rural unpleasant, urban pleasant and urban unpleasant. The control was running without exposure to images. Blood pressure and two psychological measures (self-esteem and mood) were measured before and after the intervention. There was a clear effect of both exercise and different scenes on blood pressure, self-esteem and mood. Exercise alone significantly reduced blood pressure, increased self-esteem, and had a positive significant effect on 4 of 6 mood measures. Both rural and urban pleasant scenes produced a significantly greater positive effect on self-esteem than the exercise-only control. This shows the synergistic effect of green exercise in both rural and urban environments. By contrast, both rural and urban unpleasant scenes reduced the positive effects of exercise on self-esteem. The rural unpleasant scenes had the most dramatic effect, depressing the beneficial effects of exercise on three different measures of mood. It appears that threats to the countryside depicted in rural unpleasant scenes have a greater negative effect on mood than already urban unpleasant scenes. We conclude that green exercise has important public and environmental health consequences.},

abstract = {Existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods are mostly designed in a disposable way and cannot evolve with unseen distortions adaptively, which greatly limits the deployment and application of BIQA models in real-world scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel Lifelong blind Image Quality Assessment (LIQA) approach, targeting to achieve the lifelong learning of BIQA. Without accessing to previous training data, our proposed LIQA can not only learn new distortions, but also mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of seen distortions. Specifically, we adopt the Split-and-Merge distillation strategy to train a single-head network that makes task-agnostic predictions. In the split stage, we first employ a distortion-specific generator to obtain the pseudo features of each seen distortion. Then, we use an auxiliary multi-head regression network to generate the predicted quality of each seen distortion. In the merge stage, we replay the pseudo features paired with pseudo labels to distill the knowledge of multiple heads, which can build the final regressed single head. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LIQA method can handle the continuous shifts of different distortion types and even datasets. More importantly, our LIQA model can achieve stable performance even if the task sequence is long.},

abstract = {Some climate datasets are incomplete at certain places and times. A novel technique called the point estimation model of Biased Sentinel Hospitals-based Area Disease Estimation(P-BSHADE)is introduced to interpolate missing data in temperature datasets. Effectiveness of the technique was empirically evaluated in terms of an annual temperature dataset from 1950 to 2000 in China. The P-BSHADE technique uses a weighted summation of observed stations to derive unbiased and minimum error variance estimates of missing data. Both the ratio and covariance between stations were used in calculation of these weights. In this way, interpolation of missing data in the temperature dataset was improved, and best linear unbiased esti- mates (BLUE) were obtained. Using the same dataset, performance of P-BSHADE was compared against three estimators: kriging, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and spatial regression test (SRT). Kriging and IDW assume a homogeneous stochastic field, which may not be the case. SRT employs spatiotemporal data and has the potential to consider temperature nonhomogeneity caused by topographic differences, but has no objective function for the BLUE. Instead, P-BSHADEtakes into account geographic spatial autocorrelation and nonhomogeneity, and maximizes an objective function for the BLUE of the target station. In addition to the theoretical advantages of P-BSHADE over the three other methods, case studies for an annual Chinese temperature dataset demonstrate its empirical superiority, except for the SRT from 1950 to 1970.},

abstract = {Current methods for training robust networks lead to a drop in test accuracy, which has led prior works to posit that a robustness-accuracy tradeoff may be inevitable in deep learning. We take a closer look at this phenomenon and first show that real image datasets are actually separated. With this property in mind, we then prove that robustness and accuracy should both be achievable for benchmark datasets through locally Lipschitz functions, and hence, there should be no inherent tradeoff between robustness and accuracy. Through extensive experiments with robustness methods, we argue that the gap between theory and practice arises from two limitations of current methods: either they fail to impose local Lipschitzness or they are insufficiently generalized. We explore combining dropout with robust training methods and obtain better generalization. We conclude that achieving robustness and accuracy in practice may require using methods that impose local Lipschitzness and augmenting them with deep learning generalization techniques.

Each topology has its own requirements and, based on the application, different optical components may be involved in the re-spective designs. In addition, there are hybrid network topologies that may consist of stars and/or rings that are interconnected with point-to-point links. For example, the Metropolitan Optical Network project (MONET) is a WDM network developed for and funded by a number of private companies and by U.S. government agencies. It consists of two sub-networks, one located in New Jersey and one in the Washington, D.C./Maryland area; the two are interconnected with a long-distance point-to-point optical link. 16.2 POINT-TO-POINT TOPOLOGY Point-to-point topology is predominantly for long-haul transport that requires ultrahigh speed (10-40 Gb/s), ultrahigh aggregate bandwidth (in the order of several ter-abits per second), high signal integrity, great reliability, and fast path restoration capa-bility. The distance between transmitter and receiver may be several hundred kilome-ters, and the number of amplifiers between the two end points is typically less than 10 (as determined by power loss and signal distortion). Point-to-point with add-drop mul-tiplexing enables the system to drop and add channels along its path.

abstract = {Segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain image data has a significant impact on the computer guided medical image diagnosis and analysis. However, due to limitation of image acquisition devices and other related factors, MRI images are severely affected by the noise and inhomogeneity artefacts which lead to blurry edges in the intersection of the intra-organ soft tissue regions, making the segmentation process more difficult and challenging. This paper presents a novel two-stage fuzzy multi-objective framework (2sFMoF) for segmenting 3D MRI brain image data. In the first stage, a 3D spatial fuzzy c-means (3DSpFCM) algorithm is introduced by incorporating the 3D spatial neighbourhood information of the volume data to define a new local membership function along with the global membership function for each voxel. In particular, the membership functions actually define the underlying relationship between the voxels of a close cubic neighbourhood and image data in 3D image space. The cluster prototypes thus obtained are fed into a 3D modified fuzzy c-means (3DMFCM) algorithm, which further incorporates local voxel information to generate the final prototypes. The proposed framework addresses the shortcomings of the traditional FCM algorithm, which is highly sensitive to noise and may stuck into a local minima. The method is validated on a synthetic image volume and several simulated and in-vivo 3D MRI brain image volumes and found to be effective even in noisy data. The empirical results show the supremacy of the proposed method over the other FCM based algorithms and other related methods devised in the recent past.},

abstract = {Unsupervised image representations have significantly reduced the gap with supervised pretraining, notably with the recent achievements of contrastive learning methods. These contrastive methods typically work online and rely on a large number of explicit pairwise feature comparisons, which is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, SwAV, that takes advantage of contrastive methods without requiring to compute pairwise comparisons. Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or âviewsâ) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, we use a âswappedâ prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large and small batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method is more memory efficient since it does not require a large memory bank or a special momentum network. In addition, we also propose a new data augmentation strategy, multi-crop, that uses a mix of views with different resolutions in place of two full-resolution views, without increasing the memory or compute requirements much. We validate our findings by achieving 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, as well as surpassing supervised pretraining on all the considered transfer tasks.},

Still, creating these general-purpose models remains an expensive and time-consuming process restricting the use of these methods to a small sub-set of the wider NLP community. In this paper, we present Transformers, a library for state-of-the-art NLP, making these developments available to the community by gathering state-of-the-art general-purpose pretrained models under a unified API together with an ecosystem of libraries, examples, tutorials and scripts targeting many downstream NLP tasks. Transformers features carefully crafted model implementations and high-performance pretrained weights for two main deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow, while supporting all the necessary tools to analyze, evaluate and use these models in downstream tasks such as text/token classification, questions answering and language generation among others. Transformers has gained significant organic traction and adoption among both the researcher and practitioner communities. We are committed at Hugging Face to pursue the efforts to develop Transformers with the ambition of creating the standard library for building NLP systems.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The recent development of sequencing technologies revolutionized our understanding of the inner workings of the cell as well as the way disease is treated. A single RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiment, however, measures tens of thousands of parameters simultaneously. While the results are information rich, data analysis provides a challenge. Dimensionality reduction methods help with this task by extracting patterns from the data by compressing it into compact vector representations. RESULTS: We present the factorized embeddings (FE) model, a self-supervised deep learning algorithm that learns simultaneously, by tensor factorization, gene and sample representation spaces. We ran the model on RNA-Seq data from two large-scale cohorts and observed that the sample representation captures information on single gene and global gene expression patterns. Moreover, we found that the gene representation space was organized such that tissue-specific genes, highly correlated genes as well as genes participating in the same GO terms were grouped. Finally, we compared the vector representation of samples learned by the FE model to other similar models on 49 regression tasks. We report that the representations trained with FE rank first or second in all of the tasks, surpassing, sometimes by a considerable margin, other representations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A toy example in the form of a Jupyter Notebook as well as the code and trained embeddings for this project can be found at: https://github.com/TrofimovAssya/FactorizedEmbeddings.

abstract = {We propose an attention-injective deformable convolutional network called ADCrowdNet for crowd understanding that can address the accuracy degradation problem of highly congested noisy scenes. ADCrowdNet contains two concatenated networks. An attention-aware network called Attention Map Generator (AMG) first detects crowd regions in images and computes the congestion degree of these regions. Based on detected crowd regions and congestion priors, a multi-scale deformable network called Density Map Estimator (DME) then generates high-quality density maps. With the attention-aware training scheme and multi-scale deformable convolutional scheme, the proposed ADCrowdNet achieves the capability of being more effective to capture the crowd features and more resistant to various noises. We have evaluated our method on four popular crowd counting datasets (ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, WorldEXPO'10, and UCSD) and an extra vehicle counting dataset TRANCOS, and our approach beats existing state-of-the-art approaches on all of these datasets.},

abstract = {The ability to incrementally learn new classes is crucial to the development of real-world artificial intelligence systems. In this paper, we focus on a challenging but practical few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) problem. FSCIL requires CNN models to incrementally learn new classes from very few labelled samples, without forgetting the previously learned ones. To address this problem, we represent the knowledge using a neural gas (NG) network, which can learn and preserve the topology of the feature manifold formed by different classes. On this basis, we propose the TOpology-Preserving knowledge InCrementer (TOPIC) framework. TOPIC mitigates the forgetting of the old classes by stabilizing NG's topology and improves the representation learning for few-shot new classes by growing and adapting NG to new training samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art class-incremental learning methods on CIFAR100, mini-ImageNet, and CUB200 datasets.},

abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting remains a severe hindrance to the broad application of artificial neural networks (ANNs), however, it continues to be a poorly understood phenomenon. Despite the extensive amount of work on catastrophic forgetting, we argue that it is still unclear how exactly the phenomenon should be quantified, and, moreover, to what degree all of the choices we make when designing learning systems affect the amount of catastrophic forgetting. We use various testbeds from the reinforcement learning and supervised learning literature to (1) provide evidence that the choice of which modern gradient-based optimization algorithm is used to train an ANN has a significant impact on the amount of catastrophic forgetting and show that--surprisingly--in many instances classical algorithms such as vanilla SGD experience less catastrophic forgetting than the more modern algorithms such as Adam. We empirically compare four different existing metrics for quantifying catastrophic forgetting and (2) show that the degree to which the learning systems experience catastrophic forgetting is sufficiently sensitive to the metric used that a change from one principled metric to another is enough to change the conclusions of a study dramatically. Our results suggest that a much more rigorous experimental methodology is required when looking at catastrophic forgetting. Based on our results, we recommend inter-task forgetting in supervised learning must be measured with both retention and relearning metrics concurrently, and intra-task forgetting in reinforcement learning must--at the very least--be measured with pairwise interference.},

abstract = {Extracting entities and relations for types of interest from text is important for understanding massive text corpora. Traditionally, systems of entity relation extraction have relied on human-annotated corpora for training and adopted an incremental pipeline. Such systems require additional human expertise to be ported to a new domain, and are vulnerable to errors cascading down the pipeline. In this paper, we investigate joint extraction of typed entities and relations with labeled data heuristically obtained from knowledge bases (i.e., distant supervision). As our algorithm for type labeling via distant supervision is context-agnostic, noisy training data poses unique challenges for the task. We propose a novel domain-independent framework, called COTYPE, that runs a data-driven text segmentation algorithm to extract entity mentions, and jointly embeds entity mentions, relation mentions, text features and type labels into two low-dimensional spaces (for entity and relation mentions respectively), where, in each space, objects whose types are close will also have similar representations. COTYPE, then using these learned embeddings, estimates the types of test (unlinkable) mentions. We formulate a joint optimization problem to learn embeddings from text corpora and knowledge bases, adopting a novel partial-label loss function for noisy labeled data and introducing an object "translation" function to capture the cross-constraints of entities and relations on each other. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of COTYPE across different domains (e.g., news, biomedical), with an average of 25% improvement in F1 score compared to the next best method.},

In this paper, we calibrate the distribution of these few-sample classes by transferring statistics from the classes with sufficient examples, then an adequate number of examples can be sampled from the calibrated distribution to expand the inputs to the classifier. We assume every dimension in the feature representation follows a Gaussian distribution so that the mean and the variance of the distribution can borrow from that of similar classes whose statistics are better estimated with an adequate number of samples. Our method can be built on top of off-the-shelf pretrained feature extractors and classification models without extra parameters. We show that a simple logistic regression classifier trained using the features sampled from our calibrated distribution can outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy on two datasets ($\sim$5% improvement on miniImageNet compared to the next best).

However, neural networks suffer from the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, which makes continual or lifelong learning problematic.

Specifically, we consider the representative object detector, Faster R-CNN, for both accurate and efficient prediction. To prevent abrupt performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting, we propose to apply knowledge distillation on both the region proposal network and the region classification network, to retain the detection of previously trained classes. A pseudo-positive-aware sampling strategy is also introduced for distillation sample selection. We evaluate the proposed method on PASCAL VOC 2007 and MS COCO benchmarks and show competitive mAP and 6x inference speed improvement, which makes the approach more suitable for real-time applications.

Therefore, the incremental learning capability is a critical feature for a robust and personalized object detection system that many applications would rely on. In this paper, we present an efficient yet practical system, RILOD, to incrementally train an existing object detection model such that it can detect new object classes without losing its capability to detect old classes. The key component of RILOD is a novel incremental learning algorithm that trains end-to-end for one-stage deep object detection models only using training data of new object classes. Specifically to avoid catastrophic forgetting, the algorithm distills three types of knowledge from the old model to mimic the old model's behavior on object classification, bounding box regression and feature extraction. In addition, since the training data for the new classes may not be available, a real-time dataset construction pipeline is designed to collect training images on-the-fly and automatically label the images with both category and bounding box annotations. We have implemented RILOD under both edge-cloud and edge-only setups. Experiment results show that the proposed system can learn to detect a new object class in just a few minutes, including both dataset construction and model training. In comparison, traditional fine-tuning based method may take a few hours for training, and in most cases would also need a tedious and costly manual dataset labeling step.},

The fundamental roadblock faced by deep learning methods is that deep learning models are optimized as "black boxes," making it difficult to properly adjust the model parameters to preserve knowledge about previously seen data. To overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting, we propose utilizing an alternative "white box" architecture derived from the principle of rate reduction, where each layer of the network is explicitly computed without back propagation. Under this paradigm, we demonstrate that, given a pre-trained network and new data classes, our approach can provably construct a new network that emulates joint training with all past and new classes. Finally, our experiments show that our proposed learning algorithm observes significantly less decay in classification performance, outperforming state of the art methods on MNIST and CIFAR-10 by a large margin and justifying the use of "white box" algorithms for incremental learning even for sufficiently complex image data.},

The idea is that by matching forecast data with similar forecast data in the historical data set it is possible then to obtain actual weather data and through this pollution data. To aggregate time points with similar forecast data determined by a distance function, fuzzy numbers are generated from the forecast data, covering forecast data and actual data. Again using a distance function, actual data is compared with the fuzzy number to determine how the grade of membership is. The model was prepared in such a way that all the data which is usually imprecise, chaotic, uncertain can be used.

abstract = {Recent work has explored the possibility of pruning neural networks at initialization. We assess proposals for doing so: SNIP (Lee et al., 2019), GraSP (Wang et al., 2020), SynFlow (Tanaka et al., 2020), and magnitude pruning. Although these methods surpass the trivial baseline of random pruning, they remain below the accuracy of magnitude pruning after training, and we endeavor to understand why. We show that, unlike pruning after training, accuracy is the same or higher when randomly shuffling which weights these methods prune within each layer or sampling new initial values. As such, the per-weight pruning decisions made by these methods can be replaced by a per-layer choice of the fraction of weights to prune. This property undermines the claimed justifications for these methods and suggests broader challenges with the underlying pruning heuristics, the desire to prune at initialization, or both.},

In this paper, we consider an alternative formulation called dataset distillation: we keep the model fixed and instead attempt to distill the knowledge from a large training dataset into a small one. The idea is to synthesize a small number of data points that do not need to come from the correct data distribution, but will, when given to the learning algorithm as training data, approximate the model trained on the original data. For example, we show that it is possible to compress 60,000 MNIST training images into just 10 synthetic distilled images (one per class) and achieve close to original performance with only a few gradient descent steps, given a fixed network initialization. We evaluate our method in various initialization settings and with different learning objectives. Experiments on multiple datasets show the advantage of our approach compared to alternative methods.},

abstract = {Abstract Sophisticated wave models like the Wave Model (WAM) and Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN)/WAVEWATCH are used nowadays along with atmospheric models to produce forecasts of ocean wave conditions. These models are generally run operationally on large ocean-scale domains. In many coastal areas, on the other hand, operational forecasting is not performed for a variety of reasons, yet the need for wave forecasts remains. To address such cases, the production of forecasts through the use of artificial neural networks and buoy measurements is explored. A modeling strategy that predicts wave heights up to 24 h on the basis of judiciously selected measurements over the previous 7 days was examined. A detailed investigation of this strategy using data from six National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys with diverse geographical and statistical properties demonstrates that 6-h forecasts can be obtained with a high level of fidelity, and forecasts up to 12 h showed a correlation of 67% or better relative to a fu...},

On the one hand, repeatedly training the representation on the extended dataset is time-consuming. On the other hand, fine-tuning the learned representation only with the new classes leads to catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we propose an incremental learning method to mitigate retrieval performance degradation caused by the forgetting issue. Without accessing any samples of the original classes, the classifier of the original network provides soft âlabelsâ to transfer knowledge to train the adaptive network, so as to preserve the previous capability for classification. More importantly, a regularization function based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy is devised to minimize the discrepancy of new classes features from the original network and the adaptive network, respectively. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that our method effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting on the original classes while achieving high performance on the new classes.},

abstract = {In the online continual learning paradigm, agents must learn from a changing distribution while respecting memory and compute constraints. Experience Replay (ER), where a small subset of past data is stored and replayed alongside new data, has emerged as a simple and effective learning strategy. In this work, we focus on the change in representations of observed data that arises when previously unobserved classes appear in the incoming data stream, and new classes must be distinguished from previous ones. We shed new light on this question by showing that applying ER causes the newly added classes' representations to overlap significantly with the previous classes, leading to highly disruptive parameter updates. Based on this empirical analysis, we propose a new method which mitigates this issue by shielding the learned representations from drastic adaptation to accommodate new classes. We show that using an asymmetric update rule pushes new classes to adapt to the older ones (rather than the reverse), which is more effective especially at task boundaries, where much of the forgetting typically occurs. Empirical results show significant gains over strong baselines on standard continual learning benchmarks},

abstract = {Some climate datasets are incomplete at certain places and times. A novel technique called the point estimation model of Biased Sentinel Hospitals-based Area Disease Estimation(P-BSHADE)is introduced to interpolate missing data in temperature datasets. Effectiveness of the technique was empirically evaluated in terms of an annual temperature dataset from 1950 to 2000 in China. The P-BSHADE technique uses a weighted summation of observed stations to derive unbiased and minimum error variance estimates of missing data. Both the ratio and covariance between stations were used in calculation of these weights. In this way, interpolation of missing data in the temperature dataset was improved, and best linear unbiased esti- mates (BLUE) were obtained. Using the same dataset, performance of P-BSHADE was compared against three estimators: kriging, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and spatial regression test (SRT). Kriging and IDW assume a homogeneous stochastic field, which may not be the case. SRT employs spatiotemporal data and has the potential to consider temperature nonhomogeneity caused by topographic differences, but has no objective function for the BLUE. Instead, P-BSHADEtakes into account geographic spatial autocorrelation and nonhomogeneity, and maximizes an objective function for the BLUE of the target station. In addition to the theoretical advantages of P-BSHADE over the three other methods, case studies for an annual Chinese temperature dataset demonstrate its empirical superiority, except for the SRT from 1950 to 1970.},

This paper presents an efficient solution which explores the visual patterns within each cropped region with minimal costs. We build our framework upon a representative one-stage keypoint-based detector named CornerNet. Our approach, named CenterNet, detects each object as a triplet, rather than a pair, of keypoints, which improves both precision and recall. Accordingly, we design two customized modules named cascade corner pooling and center pooling, which play the roles of enriching information collected by both top-left and bottom-right corners and providing more recognizable information at the central regions, respectively. On the MS-COCO dataset, CenterNet achieves an AP of 47.0%, which outperforms all existing one-stage detectors by at least 4.9%. Meanwhile, with a faster inference speed, CenterNet demonstrates quite comparable performance to the top-ranked two-stage detectors. Code is available at https://github.com/Duankaiwen/CenterNet.},

Notably, in the recent work of MoCo, unsupervised pretraining1 has shown to surpass the supervised counterpart for finetuning downstream applications such as object detection on PASCAL VOC. It comes as a surprise that image annotations would be better left unused for transfer learning. In this work, we investigate the following problems: What makes instance discrimination pretraining good for transfer learning? What knowledge is actually learned and transferred from unsupervised pretraining? From this understanding of unsupervised pretraining, can we make supervised pretraining great again? Our findings are threefold. First, what truly matters for this detection transfer is low-level and mid-level representations, not high-level representations. Second, the intra-category invariance enforced by the traditional supervised model weakens transferability by increasing task misalignment. Finally, supervised pretraining can be strengthened by following an exemplar-based approach without explicit constraints among the instances within the same category.},

The model solves the mass, momentum and energy for the air flow, coupled with the k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model. The equations are solved by a FV discretization technique in a structured grid. Appropriated boundary conditions and the dimension of the domain were studied for more accuracy in numeric simulation. The influence of the free stream velocity profile and wind direction upon the efficiency of a natural ventilation system under isothermal conditions has been tested. The results obtained so far confirm the validity of the implemented model and its possible use for the optimal design of natural ventilation systems.},

In this context, we discover, against all beliefs, that fine-tuning the whole architecture with these few images is not only meaningful, but also very effective. We show how the main problems of end-to-end training in this scenario are i) the drift of the batch-normalization statistics toward novel classes that we can fix with batch renormalization and ii) the forgetting of old classes, that we can fix with regularization strategies.

In this paper, we propose a method to perform active learning of object detectors based on convolutional neural networks. We propose a new image-level scoring process to rank unlabeled images for their automatic selection, which clearly outperforms classical scores. The proposed method can be applied to videos and sets of still images. In the former case, temporal selection rules can complement our scoring process. As a relevant use case, we extensively study the performance of our method on the task of pedestrian detection.

We investigate their systematic generalization abilities on a logical reasoning task in natural language, which involves reasoning over relationships between entities grounded in first-order logical proofs. Specifically, we perform soft theorem-proving by leveraging TLMs to generate natural language proofs. We test the generated proofs for logical consistency, along with the accuracy of the final inference. We observe length-generalization issues when evaluated on longer-than-trained sequences. However, we observe TLMs improve their generalization performance after being exposed to longer, exhaustive proofs. In addition, we discover that TLMs are able to generalize better using backward-chaining proofs compared to their forward-chaining counterparts, while they find it easier to generate forward chaining proofs. We observe that models that are not trained to generate proofs are better at generalizing to problems based on longer proofs. This suggests that Transformers have efficient internal reasoning strategies that are harder to interpret. These results highlight the systematic generalization behavior of TLMs in the context of logical reasoning, and we believe this work motivates deeper inspection of their underlying reasoning strategies.},

The crucial property of actuators is to possess negligible recoverable strain after millions of fatigue cycles. With the increasing applications of shape-memory alloys, the fatigue and crack propagation behavior, failure mechanisms, using phenomelogical curves are very crutial and hence the mechanisms are discussed in detail. Although, several metals exhibit shape-memory effect, NiâTi and Cu based alloys are widely used. The present chapter discusses fatigue properties and related theories, crack initiation, phase transformation and the dependent properties, superlasticity, mechanical properties such as stressâstrain curves, phase deformation and work hardening of single crystal, polycrystalline shape-memory alloys are presented with evidence from literature on both theoritical and experimental models.},

abstract = {Neural networks struggle to learn continuously, as they forget the old knowledge catastrophically whenever the data distribution changes over time. Recently, Continual Learning has inspired a plethora of approaches and evaluation settings; however, the majority of them overlooks the properties of a practical scenario, where the data stream cannot be shaped as a sequence of tasks and offline training is not viable. We work towards General Continual Learning (GCL), where task boundaries blur and the domain and class distributions shift either gradually or suddenly. We address it through Dark Experience Replay, namely matching the network's logits sampled throughout the optimization trajectory, thus promoting consistency with its past. By conducting an extensive analysis on top of standard benchmarks, we show that such a seemingly simple baseline outperforms consolidated approaches and leverages limited resources. To provide a better understanding, we further introduce MNIST-360, a novel GCL evaluation setting.},

abstract = {This work studies the activity of activated CaO as a catalyst in the production of biodiesel by transesterification of triglycerides with methanol. Three basic aspects were investigated: the role of H2O and CO2in the deterioration of the catalytic performance by contact with room air, the stability of the catalyst by reutilization in successive runs and the heterogeneous character of the catalytic reaction. The characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD), evolved gas analysis by mass spectrometry (EGA-MS) during heating the sample under programmed temperature, X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies allowed to concluding that CaO is rapidly hydrated and carbonated by contact with room air. Few minutes are enough to chemisorb significant amount of H2O and CO2. It is demonstrated that the CO2is the main deactivating agent whereas the negative effect water is less important. As a matter of fact the surface of the activated catalyst is better described as an inner core of CaO particles covered by very few layers of Ca(OH)2. The activation by outgassing at temperatures â¥973 K are required to revert the CO2poisoning. The catalyst can be reused for several runs without significant deactivation. The catalytic reaction is the result of the heterogeneous and homogeneous contributions. Part of the reaction takes place on basic sites at the surface of the catalyst, the rest is due to the dissolution of the activated CaO in methanol that creates homogeneous leached active species. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the performance of neural networks for perimetric glaucoma diagnosis when using different types of data inputs: numerical threshold sensitivities, Statpac Total Deviation and Pattern Deviation, and probability scores based on Total and Pattern Deviation probability maps (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). METHODS: The results of SITA Standard visual field tests in 213 healthy subjects, 127 patients with glaucoma, 68 patients with concomitant glaucoma and cataract, and 41 patients with cataract only were included. The five different types of input data were entered into five identically designed artificial neural networks. Network thresholds were adjusted for each network. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to display the combinations of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Input data in the form of Pattern Deviation probability scores gave the best results, with an area of 0.988 under the ROC curve, and were significantly better (P < 0.001) than threshold sensitivities and numerical Total Deviations and Total Deviation probability scores. The second best result was obtained with numerical Pattern Deviations with an area of 0.980. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of type of data input had important effects on the performance of the neural networks in glaucoma diagnosis. Refined input data, based on Pattern Deviations, resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity than did raw threshold values. Neural networks may have high potential in the production of useful clinical tools for the classification of visual field tests.},

There are two area of concern for improving K-means; 1) is to select initial centroids and 2) by assigning data points to nearest cluster by using equations for calculating mean and distance between two data points. The time complexity of the proposed K-means technique will be lesser that then the traditional one with increase in accuracy and efficiency. The main purpose of the article is to proposed techniques to enhance the techniques for deriving initial centroids and the assigning of the data points to its nearest clusters. The clustering technique proposed in this paper is enhancing the accuracy and time complexity but it still needs some further improvements and in future it is also viable to include efficient techniques for selecting value for initial clusters(k). Experimental results show that the improved method can effectively improve the speed of clustering and accuracy, reducing the computational complexity of the k-means.},

Although simply replaying all previous data alleviates the problem, it requires large memory and even worse, often infeasible in real world applications where the access to past data is limited. Inspired by the generative nature of the hippocampus as a short-term memory system in primate brain, we propose the Deep Generative Replay, a novel framework with a cooperative dual model architecture consisting of a deep generative model ("generator") and a task solving model ("solver"). With only these two models, training data for previous tasks can easily be sampled and interleaved with those for a new task.

abstract = {A split-transform-merge strategy has been broadly used as an architectural constraint in convolutional neural networks for visual recognition tasks. It approximates sparsely connected networks by explicitly defining multiple branches to simultaneously learn representations with different visual concepts or properties. Dependencies or interactions between these representations are typically defined by dense and local operations, however, without any adaptiveness or high-level reasoning. In this work, we propose to exploit this strategy and combine it with our Visual Concept Reasoning Networks (VCRNet) to enable reasoning between high-level visual concepts. We associate each branch with a visual concept and derive a compact concept state by selecting a few local descriptors through an attention module. These concept states are then updated by graph-based interaction and used to adaptively modulate the local descriptors. We describe our proposed model by split-transform-attend-interact-modulate-merge stages, which are implemented by opting for a highly modularized architecture. Extensive experiments on visual recognition tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, scene recognition, and action recognition show that our proposed model, VCRNet, consistently improves the performance by increasing the number of parameters by less than 1%.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks often work well when they are over-parameterized and trained with a massive amount of noise and regularization, such as weight decay and dropout. Although dropout is widely used as a regularization technique for fully connected layers, it is often less effective for convolutional layers. This lack of success of dropout for convolutional layers is perhaps due to the fact that activation units in convolutional layers are spatially correlated so information can still flow through convolutional networks despite dropout. Thus a structured form of dropout is needed to regularize convolutional networks. In this paper, we introduce DropBlock, a form of structured dropout, where units in a contiguous region of a feature map are dropped together. We found that applying DropbBlock in skip connections in addition to the convolution layers increases the accuracy. Also, gradually increasing number of dropped units during training leads to better accuracy and more robust to hyperparameter choices. Extensive experiments show that DropBlock works better than dropout in regularizing convolutional networks. On ImageNet classification, ResNet-50 architecture with DropBlock achieves 78.13% accuracy, which is more than 1.6% improvement on the baseline. On COCO detection, DropBlock improves Average Precision of RetinaNet from 36.8% to 38.4%.},

abstract = {Incremental life-long learning is a main challenge towards the long-standing goal of Artificial General Intelligence. In real-life settings, learning tasks arrive in a sequence and machine learning models must continually learn to increment already acquired knowledge. Existing incremental learning approaches, fall well below the state-of-the-art cumulative models that use all training classes at once. In this paper, we propose a random path selection algorithm, called RPS-Net, that progressively chooses optimal paths for the new tasks while encouraging parameter sharing. Since the reuse of previous paths enables forward knowledge transfer, our approach requires a considerably lower computational overhead. As an added novelty, the proposed model integrates knowledge distillation and retrospection along with the path selection strategy to overcome catastrophic forgetting. In order to maintain an equilibrium between previous and newly acquired knowledge, we propose a simple controller to dynamically balance the model plasticity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art performance on incremental learning and by utilizing parallel computation this method can run in constant time with nearly the same efficiency as a conventional deep convolutional neural network.},

Finally, six linear empirical models were obtained with decreasing slopes of 0.001544â0.001841 between fine aerosol deposition density and transmittance ratio. These observed phenomena and derived models would be useful for solar energy, building illumination or heat-transfer, and BIPV industries.},

abstract = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) modeling and simulation techniques are utilized to boost the usefulness of a common DC-output photovoltaic (PV) system. Vast studies in the literature are mostly based on single-input single-output (SISO) methods. As a result they suffer numerous unpredicted features should they be exposed to particular temperature, irradiation and load changes. These features stem from parameter errors and unmodelled dynamics of actual circuit components. Another issue is that common linearization may fail due to substantial nonlinear behavior. These are caused by switching converters run by means of pulse width modulation (PWM). As a remedy a different method relying on simulated input/output data is put to use to compute a working condition and then obtaining a linear model of the entire system around it. Multiple SISO compensators are replaced with a single MIMO robust controller based on the MIMO model, after which the controlled system is tested in simulations with varying irradiation, temperature and load resistance values. Evaluating the outcomes unveils the fact that newly designed autonomous system can run the PV panel at the maximum power point over a wide envelope of atmospheric and load combinations. Moreover the voltage value fed to a sensitive load is constant and the extra power obtained from the PV panel is used to charge the battery.},

abstract = {Machine learning on graphs is an important and ubiquitous task with applications ranging from drug design to friendship recommendation in social networks. The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

However, this approach is typically applied post-hoc to networks trained with cross-entropy loss, which neither guarantees nor encourages the hoped-for clustering behaviour. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Class Anchor Clustering (CAC) loss. CAC is an entirely distance-based loss that explicitly encourages training data to form tight clusters around class-dependent anchor points in the logit space. We show that an open set classifier trained with CAC loss outperforms all state-of-the-art techniques on the challenging TinyImageNet dataset, achieving a 2.4% performance increase in AUROC. In addition, our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art distance-based approaches on a number of further relevant datasets. We will make the code for CAC publicly available.},

Probabilistic generative mod-els based on these functions are developed to account for the observed RGB-D imagery, and tracking is posed as a maxi-mum a posteriori problem. We present first a method suited to tracking a single rigid 3D object, and then generalise this to multiple objects by combining distance functions into a shape union in the frame of the camera. This second model accounts for similarity and proximity between objects, and leads to robust real-time tracking without recourse to bolt-on or ad-hoc collision detection.},

A common remedy is replay, which is inspired by how the brain consolidates memory. Replay involves fine-tuning a network on a mixture of new and old instances. While there is neuroscientific evidence that the brain replays compressed memories, existing methods for convolutional networks replay raw images. Here, we propose REMIND, a brain-inspired approach that enables efficient replay with compressed representations. REMIND is trained in an online manner, meaning it learns one example at a time, which is closer to how humans learn. Under the same constraints, REMIND outperforms other methods for incremental class learning on the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset. We probe REMIND's robustness to data ordering schemes known to induce catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate REMIND's generality by pioneering online learning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) (https://github.com/tyler-hayes/REMIND).},

abstract = {Face recognition sees remarkable progress in recent years, and its performance has reached a very high level. Taking it to a next level requires substantially larger data, which would involve prohibitive annotation cost. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data becomes an appealing alternative. Recent works have shown that clustering unlabeled faces is a promising approach, often leading to notable performance gains. Yet, how to effectively cluster, especially on a large-scale (i.e. million-level or above) dataset, remains an open question. A key challenge lies in the complex variations of cluster patterns, which make it difficult for conventional clustering methods to meet the needed accuracy. This work explores a novel approach, namely, learning to cluster instead of relying on hand-crafted criteria. Specifically, we propose a framework based on graph convolutional network, which combines a detection and a segmentation module to pinpoint face clusters. Experiments show that our method yields significantly more accurate face clusters, which, as a result, also lead to further performance gain in face recognition.},

We introduce a vector quantization method that aims at preserving the quality of the reconstruction of the network outputs rather than its weights. The principle of our approach is that it minimizes the loss reconstruction error for in-domain inputs. Our method only requires a set of unlabelled data at quantization time and allows for efficient inference on CPU by using byte-aligned codebooks to store the compressed weights. We validate our approach by quantizing a high performing ResNet-50 model to a memory size of 5MB (20x compression factor) while preserving a top-1 accuracy of 76.1% on ImageNet object classification and by compressing a Mask R-CNN with a 26x factor.},

abstract = {Images captured under low-light conditions manifest poor visibility, lack contrast and color vividness. Compared to conventional approaches, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform well in enhancing images. However, being solely reliant on confined fixed primitives to model dependencies, existing data-driven deep models do not exploit the contexts at various spatial scales to address low-light image enhancement. These contexts can be crucial towards inferring several image enhancement tasks, e.g., local and global contrast, brightness and color corrections; which requires cues from both local and global spatial extent. To this end, we introduce a context-aware deep network for low-light image enhancement. First, it features a global context module that models spatial correlations to find complementary cues over full spatial domain. Second, it introduces a dense residual block that captures local context with a relatively large receptive field. We evaluate the proposed approach using three challenging datasets: MIT-Adobe FiveK, LoL, and SID. On all these datasets, our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-arts in terms of standard image fidelity metrics. In particular, compared to the best performing method on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, our algorithm improves PSNR from 23.04 dB to 24.45 dB.},

abstract = {Photocatalysis is an emerging technology that enables a wide variety of applications, including degradation of organics and dyes, antibacterial action, and fuel generation through water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction. Numerous inorganic semiconducting materials have been explored as photocatalysts, and the versatility of these materials and reactions has been expanded in recent years [1,2]. Understanding the relationship between the physicochemical properties of photocatalytic materials and their performances as well as the fundamentals in catalytic processes is important to design and synthesis of photocatalytic materials [3,4]. To present the state of the art of photocatalytic materials and their applications, as well as explore the fundamentals of photo-catalytic processes, we compiled this special issue on photocatalytic materials, which includes metal oxides (TiO 2), metal-organic frameworks (MOF), plasmonics and hybrids for applications in water splitting, CO 2 reduction, and removal of environmental pol-lutants. The aspects of this special issue cover strategies of nano-structure and heterostructure design, surface defects and modifications, and the first-principles calculations, etc. We believe that these advances will be interesting to the broad readers of Journal of Materiomics. TiO 2 has been widely investigated for photocatalysis in removal of environmental pollutants, H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction since 1972. It is generally accepted that the photocatalytic activity is affected by the light absorption, charge creation/recombination rate and surface reactivity. In this special issue, Binas et al. focused on modified TiO 2 as catalyst in heterogeneous photocatalytic processes and addressed the efficiency of TiO 2 -based building and construction materials on the removal of environmental pollutants indoors and outdoors [5]. Recent results on the disinfection per-formance of these materials and the inactivation of severe patho-gens contained in water and indoor air environments were then summarized. Blackening TiO 2 has been proposed as an effective strategy to enhance its solar absorption and thus the photocatalytic activities. Zhao et al. examined the major influences of TiO 2 point defects on CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O, by changing the catalysts' gas adsorption capabilities, optical properties, and electronic structures [6]. In addition, the performances of various defective TiO 2 toward CO 2 photoreduction were summarized and compared in terms of productivity, selectivity, and stability. The use of plasmon excitations to increase the performance of visible light-driven water splitting systems has been investigated intensely in recent years. The literature on this subject shows that multiple mechanisms are possible to explain increases in water splitting efficiency. Zhang et al. discuss the recent literature on this subject, and present an informative description and summary of the mechanisms by which excitation of plasmons can improve photocatalytic performance [7]. These include mechanisms based on light scattering, near-field effects, as well as hot electron transfer. This review article provides a timely and useful analysis of the design parameters for plasmonic-metal/semiconductor photo-catalysts as well as a welcome perspective on the future of this technology. Graphene in the form of graphene oxide (GO) has been frequently composited with TiO 2 to improve the photocatalytic properties. Tan et al. studied the impacts of addition of RGO to P25 TiO 2 on photocatalytic oxidation of various organic substances [8]. They found that RGO is not a universal promoter for photocatalytic activities of TiO 2 , but the photocatalytic activity enhancement is strongly affected by the various functional groups appeared in the organic substances. It is realized that the length of alkyl chain in alcohols and carboxylic acids have the minimum influence on the overall activity while the number of hydroxyl groups can promote the further activity enhancement in the presence of RGO. MOFs have emerged as potential promising candidates for photocatalytic H 2 production. However, the reported MOFs are lack of active sites for H 2 evolution and suffer from the low light harvest,},

abstract = {Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD) has emerged as an effective tool to train object detectors using only the image-level category labels. However, without object-level labels, WSOD detectors are prone to detect bounding boxes on salient objects, clustered objects and discriminative object parts. Moreover, the image-level category labels do not enforce consistent object detection across different transformations of the same images. To address the above issues, we propose a Comprehensive Attention Self-Distillation (CASD) training approach for WSOD. To balance feature learning among all object instances, CASD computes the comprehensive attention aggregated from multiple transformations and feature layers of the same images. To enforce consistent spatial supervision on objects, CASD conducts self-distillation on the WSOD networks, such that the comprehensive attention is approximated simultaneously by multiple transformations and feature layers of the same images. CASD produces new state-of-the-art WSOD results on standard benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 and MS-COCO.},

The contributions of this paper are in twofold. First, to introduce improved MTEJ algorithm with additional integrator term that is efficient to eliminate effects of mentioned factors or other source of steady state error (SSE). Second, using new fuzzy rules to manage its terms to stabilize system with better control properties, the controller is used to make the endeffector to both track a predefined trajectory or set on an exact point. Global stabilization of this control method is proved. Simulation and experimental results are offered which compared tracking performance of the improved fuzzy MTEJ with integrator to other methods for both tracking and point to point (P.T.P) control. Outcomes of these experiments reveal privileges of using fuzzy improved MTEJ in various areas like removing SSE with better control characteristics and low computational efforts.},

abstract = {Black phosphorus (BP), an emerging narrow direct band-gap two-dimensional (2D) layered material that can fill the gap between the semi-metallic graphene and the wide-bandgap transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), had been experimentally found to exhibit the saturation of optical absorption if under strong light illumination. By taking advantage of this saturable absorption property, we could fabricate a new type of optical saturable absorber (SA) based on mechanically exfoliated BPs, and further demonstrate the applications for ultra-fast laser photonics. Based on the balanced synchronous twin-detector measurement method, we have characterized the saturable absorption property of the fabricated BP-SAs at the telecommunication band. By incorporating the BP-based SAs device into the all-fiber Erbium-doped fiber laser cavities, we are able to obtain either the passive Q-switching (with maximum pulse energy of 94.3 nJ) or the passive mode-locking operation (with pulse duration down to 946 fs). Our results show that BP could also be developed as an effective SA for pulsed fiber or solid-state lasers.},

abstract = {Epistemic negation not along with default negation Â¬ plays a key role in knowledge representation and nonmonotonic reasoning. However, the existing epistemic approaches such as those by Gelfond [13,15,14], Truszczynski [33] and Kahl et al. [18] behave not satisfactorily in that they suffer from the problems of unintended world views due to recursion through the epistemic modal operator K or M (KF and MF are shorthands for Â¬notF and notÂ¬F, respectively). In this paper we present a new approach to handling epistemic negation which is free of unintended world views and thus offers a solution to the long-standing problem of epistemic specifications which were introduced by Gelfond [13] over two decades ago. We consider general logic programs consisting of rules of the form HâB, where H and B are arbitrary first-order formulas possibly containing epistemic negation, and define a general epistemic answer set semantics for general logic programs by introducing a novel program transformation and a new definition of world views in which we apply epistemic negation to minimize the knowledge in world views. The general epistemic semantics is applicable to extend any existing answer set semantics, such as those defined in [26,27,32,1,8,12,29], with epistemic negation. For illustration, we extend FLP answer set semantics of Faber et al. [8] for general logic programs with epistemic negation, leading to epistemic FLP semantics. We also extend the more restrictive well-justified FLP semantics of Shen et al. [29], which is free of circularity for default negation, to an epistemic well-justified semantics. We consider the computational complexity of epistemic FLP semantics and show that for a propositional program $\Pi$ with epistemic negation, deciding whether $\Pi$ has epistemic FLP answer sets is $\Sigma$3p-complete and deciding whether a propositional formula F is true in $\Pi$ under epistemic FLP semantics is $\Sigma$4p-complete in general, but has lower complexity for logic programs that match normal epistemic specifications, where the complexity of world view existence and query evaluation drops by one level in the polynomial hierarchy.},

In order to reduce fugitive emissions released in this process, the assessment of fugitive emissions should be conducted at the early stage of chemical process design when the cost of making changes is the lowest. This is however impeded by the limited knowledge on the leak sources, since the process is still under design. The paper presents a hybrid approach for estimating fugitive emission rates early in the design phase. The method combines a pre-calculated emission database of standard process module based approach with estimation by using generic piping and instrumentation diagrams if a suitable module is not available from the database. Also, both working and breathing emissions are included in the assessment. The emissions' assessment from a case study of hydrodealkylation distillation and storage systems is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Most of the existing methods for solving fully fuzzy mathematical programs are based on the standard fuzzy arithmetic operations and/or Zadeh's extension principle. These methods may produce questionable results for many real-life applications. Due to this fact, this paper presents a novel method based on the constrained fuzzy arithmetic concept to solve fully fuzzy balanced/unbalanced transportation problems in which all of the parameters (source capacities, demands of destinations, transportation costs etc.) as well as the decision variables (transportation quantities) are considered as fuzzy numbers. In the proposed method, the requisite crisp and/or fuzzy constraints between the base variables of the fuzzy components are provided from the decision maker according to his/her exact or vague judgments. Thereafter, fuzzy arithmetic operations are performed under these requisite constraints by taking into account the additional information while transforming the fuzzy transportation model into crisp equivalent form. Therefore, various fuzzy efficient solutions can be generated by making use of the proposed method according to the decision maker's risk attitude. In order to present the efficiency/applicability of the proposed method, different types of fully fuzzy transportation problems are generated and solved as illustrative examples. A detailed comparative study is also performed with other methods available in the literature. The computational analysis have shown that relatively more precise solutions are obtained from the proposed method for ârisk-averseâ and âpartially risk-averseâ decision makers. The proposed method also successfully provided fuzzy acceptable solutions for ârisk seekersâ with high degree of uncertainty similar to the other existing methods in the literature.},

abstract = {Modern object detectors rely heavily on rectangular bounding boxes, such as anchors, proposals and the final predictions, to represent objects at various recognition stages. The bounding box is convenient to use but provides only a coarse localization of objects and leads to a correspondingly coarse extraction of object features. In this paper, we present \textbf{RepPoints} (representative points), a new finer representation of objects as a set of sample points useful for both localization and recognition. Given ground truth localization and recognition targets for training, RepPoints learn to automatically arrange themselves in a manner that bounds the spatial extent of an object and indicates semantically significant local areas. They furthermore do not require the use of anchors to sample a space of bounding boxes. We show that an anchor-free object detector based on RepPoints can be as effective as the state-of-the-art anchor-based detection methods, with 46.5 AP and 67.4 $AP_{50}$ on the COCO test-dev detection benchmark, using ResNet-101 model.

To the best of our knowledge, no technique has been proposed to learn a sequence of mixed similar and dissimilar tasks that can deal with forgetting and also transfer knowledge forward and backward. This paper proposes such a technique to learn both types of tasks in the same network. For dissimilar tasks, the algorithm focuses on dealing with forgetting, and for similar tasks, the algorithm focuses on selectively transferring the knowledge learned from some similar previous tasks to improve the new task learning. Additionally, the algorithm automatically detects whether a new task is similar to any previous tasks. Empirical evaluation using sequences of mixed tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model. 2},

abstract = {Anomaly detection in surveillance videos has been recently gaining attention. Even though the performance of state-of-the-art methods on publicly available data sets has been competitive, they demand a massive amount of training data. Also, they lack a concrete approach for continuously updating the trained model once new data is available. Furthermore, online decision making is an important but mostly neglected factor in this domain. Motivated by these research gaps, we propose an online anomaly detection method for surveillance videos using transfer learning and any-shot learning, which in turn significantly reduces the training complexity and provides a mechanism which can detect anomalies using only a few labeled nominal examples. Our proposed algorithm leverages the feature extraction power of neural network-based models for transfer learning, and the any-shot learning capability of statistical detection methods.},

abstract = {In this article, the influence of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on cilia motion of particleâfluid suspension through a porous planar channel has been investigated. The governing equations of Casson fluid model for fluid phase and particulate phase are solved by taking the assumption of long wavelength and neglecting the inertial forces due to laminar flow. The solutions for the resulting differential equations have been obtained analytically and a close form of solutions is presented. The expression for pressure rise along the whole length of the channel is evaluated numerically. The influences of all the physical parameters are demonstrated graphically. Trapping mechanism has also been discussed with the help of streamlines. It is observed that due to the influence of magnetohydrodynamics and particle volume fraction, velocity of the fluid decreases. It is also found that pressure rise shows similar behaviour for particle volume fraction and Casson fluid parameter.},

abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting of connectionist neural networks is caused by the global sharing of parameters among all training examples. In this study, we analyze parameter sharing under the conditional computation framework where the parameters of a neural network are conditioned on each input example. At one extreme, if each input example uses a disjoint set of parameters, there is no sharing of parameters thus no catastrophic forgetting. At the other extreme, if the parameters are the same for every example, it reduces to the conventional neural network. We then introduce a clipped version of maxout networks which lies in the middle, i.e. parameters are shared partially among examples. Based on the parameter sharing analysis, we can locate a limited set of examples that are interfered when learning a new example. We propose to perform rehearsal on this set to prevent forgetting, which is termed as conditional rehearsal. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in an online non-stationary setup, where updates are made after each new example and the distribution of the received example shifts over time.},

abstract = {Magneto-rheological fluid (MRF) technology is an old "newcomers" coming to the market at high speed. Various industries including the automotive industry are full of potential MRF applications. Magneto-rheological fluid technology has been successfully employed already in various low and high volume applications. A structure based on MRF might be the next generation in design for products where power density, accuracy and dynamic performance are the key features. Additionally, for products where is a need to control fluid motion by varying the viscosity, a structure based on MRF might be an improvement in functionality and costs. Two aspects of this technology, direct shear mode (used in brakes and clutches) and valve mode (used in dampers) have been studied thoroughly and several applications are already present on the market. Excellent features like fast response, simple interface between electrical power input and mechanical power output, and precise controllability make MRF technology attractive for many applications. This paper presents the state of the art of an actuator with a control arrangement based on MRF technology. The study shows that excellent features like fast response, simple interface between electrical power input and the mechanical power output, and controllability make MRF the next technology of choice for many applications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This system has been validated with temperature and relative humidity data obtained from a real tobacco dryer with a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). A fitting ANN was used to estimate temperature and relative humidity in different locations inside the tobacco dryer and to predict them with different time horizons. An error under 2% can be achieved when estimating temperature as a function of temperature and relative humidity in other locations. Moreover, an error around 1.5 times lower than that obtained with an interpolation method can be achieved when predicting the temperature inside the tobacco mass as a function of its present and past values with time horizons over 150 minutes. These results show that the tobacco drying process can be improved taking into account the predicted future value of the monitored variables and the estimated actual value of other variables using a fitting ANN as proposed.},

Existing solutions usually involve class-balancing strategies, e.g. by loss re-weighting, data re-sampling, or transfer learning from head- to tail-classes, but most of them adhere to the scheme of jointly learning representations and classifiers. In this work, we decouple the learning procedure into representation learning and classification, and systematically explore how different balancing strategies affect them for long-tailed recognition. The findings are surprising: (1) data imbalance might not be an issue in learning high-quality representations; (2) with representations learned with the simplest instance-balanced (natural) sampling, it is also possible to achieve strong long-tailed recognition ability at little cost by adjusting only the classifier. We conduct extensive experiments and set new state-of-the-art performance on common long-tailed benchmarks like ImageNet-LT, Places-LT and iNaturalist, showing that it is possible to outperform carefully designed losses, sampling strategies, even complex modules with memory, by using a straightforward approach that decouples representation and classification.},

@article{Pretty2005,
abstract = {Both physical activity and exposure to nature are known separately to have positive effects on physical and mental health. We have investigated whether there is a synergistic benefit in adopting physical activities whilst being directly exposed to nature ('green exercise'). Five groups of 20 subjects were exposed to a sequence of 30 scenes projected on a wall whilst exercising on a treadmill. Four categories of scenes were tested: rural pleasant, rural unpleasant, urban pleasant and urban unpleasant. The control was running without exposure to images. Blood pressure and two psychological measures (self-esteem and mood) were measured before and after the intervention. There was a clear effect of both exercise and different scenes on blood pressure, self-esteem and mood. Exercise alone significantly reduced blood pressure, increased self-esteem, and had a positive significant effect on 4 of 6 mood measures. Both rural and urban pleasant scenes produced a significantly greater positive effect on self-esteem than the exercise-only control. This shows the synergistic effect of green exercise in both rural and urban environments. By contrast, both rural and urban unpleasant scenes reduced the positive effects of exercise on self-esteem. The rural unpleasant scenes had the most dramatic effect, depressing the beneficial effects of exercise on three different measures of mood. It appears that threats to the countryside depicted in rural unpleasant scenes have a greater negative effect on mood than already urban unpleasant scenes. We conclude that green exercise has important public and environmental health consequences.},

abstract = {Summary This chapter is intended as introductory text in the fundamentals of combustion for engineering graduate students, as well as a basis for the next four chapters. Combustion is defined as a rapid exothermic reaction that liberates substantial energy as heat and flames as combustion reactions with the ability to propagate through a suitable medium. This propagation results from the strong coupling of the reaction with the molecular transport process. The chemistry and physics of combustion, i.e. destruction and rearrangement of certain molecules, rapidly release energy within a few millionths of second. Currently, combustion is a mature discipline and an integral element of diverse research and development programs from fundamental studies of the physics of flames and high-temperature molecular chemistry to applied engineering projects involved with developments such as advanced coal-burning equipment and improved combustion furnaces, boilers, and engines. These developments are important in controlling the pollutant emissions. Therefore, it is appropriate in this chapter to present two very important practical considerations relative to the combustion reaction systems, which are the mass and energy balance used to describe such systems.},

abstract = {The impact of extreme events (such as prolonged droughts, heat waves, cold shocks and frost) is poorly represented by most of the existing yield forecasting systems. Two new model-based approaches that account for the impact of extreme weather events on crop production are presented as a way to improve yield forecasts, both based on the Crop Growth Monitoring System (CGMS) of the European Commission. A first approach includes simple relations â consistent with the degree of complexity of the most generic crop simulators â to explicitly model the impact of these events on leaf development and yield formation. A second approach is a hybrid system which adds selected agro-climatic indicators (accounting for drought and cold/heat stress) to the previous one. The new proposed methods, together with the CGMS-standard approach and a system exclusively based on selected agro-climatic indicators, were evaluated in a comparative fashion for their forecasting reliability. The four systems were assessed for the main micro- and macro-thermal cereal crops grown in highly productive European countries. The workflow included the statistical post-processing of model outputs aggregated at national level with historical series (1995â2013) of official yields, followed by a cross-validation for forecasting events triggered at flowering, maturity and at an intermediate stage. With the system based on agro-climatic indicators, satisfactory performances were limited to microthermal crops grown in Mediterranean environments (i.e. crop production systems mainly driven by rainfall distribution). Compared to CGMS-standard system, the newly proposed approaches increased the forecasting reliability in 94% of the combinations cropÂ ÃÂ countryÂ ÃÂ forecasting moment. In particular, the explicit simulation of the impact of extreme events explained a large part of the inter-annual variability (up to +44% for spring barley in Poland), while the addition of agro-climatic indicators to the workflow mostly added accuracy to an already satisfactory forecasting system.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to recover true fine surface detail of deforming meshes reconstructed from multi-view video. Template-based methods for performance capture usually produce a coarse-to-medium scale detail 4D surface reconstruction which does not contain the real high-frequency geometric detail present in the original video footage. Fine scale deformation is often incorporated in a second pass by using stereo constraints, features, or shading-based refinement. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to this second stage by formulating dense dynamic surface reconstruction as a global optimization problem of the densely deforming surface. Our main contribution is an implicit representation of a deformable mesh that uses a set of Gaussian functions on the surface to represent the initial coarse mesh, and a set of Gaussians for the images to represent the original captured multi-view images. We effectively find the fine scale deformations for all mesh vertices, which maximize photo-temporal-consistency, by densely optimizing our model-to-image consistency energy on all vertex positions. Our formulation yields a smooth closed form energy with implicit occlusion handling and analytic derivatives. Furthermore, it does not require error-prone correspondence finding or discrete sampling of surface displacement values. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of datasets of human subjects wearing loose clothing and performing different motions. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that our technique successfully reproduces finer detail than the input baseline geometry.},

Indeed, many real-world applications do not reflect the learning setting where neural networks shine, as data are usually few, mostly unlabelled and come as a stream. To narrow this gap, we introduce FUSION - Few-shot UnSupervIsed cONtinual learning - a novel strategy which aims to deal with neural networks that "learn in the wild", simulating a real distribution and flow of unbalanced tasks. We equip FUSION with MEML - Meta-Example Meta-Learning - a new module that simultaneously alleviates catastrophic forgetting and favours the generalisation and future learning of new tasks. To encourage features reuse during the meta-optimisation, our model exploits a single inner loop per task, taking advantage of an aggregated representation achieved through the use of a self-attention mechanism. To further enhance the generalisation capability of MEML, we extend it by adopting a technique that creates various augmented tasks and optimises over the hardest. Experimental results on few-shot learning benchmarks show that our model exceeds the other baselines in both FUSION and fully supervised case. We also explore how it behaves in standard continual learning consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {We consider class incremental learning (CIL) problem, in which a learning agent continuously learns new classes from incrementally arriving training data batches and aims to predict well on all the classes learned so far. The main challenge of the problem is the catastrophic forgetting, and for the exemplar-memory based CIL methods, it is generally known that the forgetting is commonly caused by the prediction score bias that is injected due to the data imbalance between the new classes and the old classes (in the exemplar-memory). While several methods have been proposed to correct such score bias by some additional post-processing, e.g., score re-scaling or balanced fine-tuning, no systematic analysis on the root cause of such bias has been done. To that end, we analyze that computing the softmax probabilities by combining the output scores for all old and new classes could be the main source of the bias and propose a new CIL method, Separated Softmax for Incremental Learning (SS-IL). Our SS-IL consists of separated softmax (SS) output layer and ratio-preserving (RP) mini-batches combined with task-wise knowledge distillation (TKD), and through extensive experimental results, we show our SS-IL achieves very strong state-of-the-art accuracy on several large-scale benchmarks. We also show SS-IL makes much more balanced prediction, without any additional post-processing steps as is done in other baselines.},

One of the key challenges of continual learning is to avoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence of more recent tasks. Over the past few years, many methods and tricks have been introduced to address this problem, but many have not been fairly and systematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings. To better understand the relative advantages of various approaches and the settings where they work best, this survey aims to (1) compare state-of-the-art methods such as MIR, iCARL, and GDumb and determine which works best at different experimental settings; (2) determine if the best class incremental methods are also competitive in domain incremental setting; (3) evaluate the performance of 7 simple but effective trick such as "review" trick and nearest class mean (NCM) classifier to assess their relative impact. Regarding (1), we observe earlier proposed iCaRL remains competitive when the memory buffer is small; GDumb outperforms many recently proposed methods in medium-size datasets and MIR performs the best in larger-scale datasets. For (2), we note that GDumb performs quite poorly while MIR -- already competitive for (1) -- is also strongly competitive in this very different but important setting. Overall, this allows us to conclude that MIR is overall a strong and versatile method across a wide variety of settings. For (3), we find that all 7 tricks are beneficial, and when augmented with the "review" trick and NCM classifier, MIR produces performance levels that bring online continual learning much closer to its ultimate goal of matching offline training.},

abstract = {Unsupervised image representations have significantly reduced the gap with supervised pretraining, notably with the recent achievements of contrastive learning methods. These contrastive methods typically work online and rely on a large number of explicit pairwise feature comparisons, which is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, SwAV, that takes advantage of contrastive methods without requiring to compute pairwise comparisons. Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or âviewsâ) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, we use a âswappedâ prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large and small batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method is more memory efficient since it does not require a large memory bank or a special momentum network. In addition, we also propose a new data augmentation strategy, multi-crop, that uses a mix of views with different resolutions in place of two full-resolution views, without increasing the memory or compute requirements much. We validate our findings by achieving 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, as well as surpassing supervised pretraining on all the considered transfer tasks.},

abstract = {The debate on low-carbon heat in Europe has become focused on a narrow range of technological options and has largely neglected hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, despite these receiving strong support towards commercialisation in Asia. This review examines the potential benefits of these technologies across different markets, particularly the current state of development and performance of fuel cell micro-CHP. Fuel cells offer some important benefits over other low-carbon heating technologies, and steady cost reductions through innovation are bringing fuel cells close to commercialisation in several countries. Moreover, fuel cells offer wider energy system benefits for high-latitude countries with peak electricity demands in winter. Hydrogen is a zero-carbon alternative to natural gas, which could be particularly valuable for those countries with extensive natural gas distribution networks, but many national energy system models examine neither hydrogen nor fuel cells for heating. There is a need to include hydrogen and fuel cell heating technologies in future scenario analyses, and for policymakers to take into account the full value of the potential contribution of hydrogen and fuel cells to low-carbon energy systems.},

abstract = {Most current Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are based on highly simplified brain dynamics. They have been used as powerful computational tools to solve complex pattern recognition, function estimation, and classification problems. ANNs have been evolving towards more powerful and more biologically realistic models. In the past decade, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been developed which comprise of spiking neurons. Information transfer in these neurons mimics the information transfer in biological neurons, i.e., via the precise timing of spikes or a sequence of spikes. To facilitate learning in such networks, new learning algorithms based on varying degrees of biological plausibility have also been developed recently. Addition of the temporal dimension for information encoding in SNNs yields new insight into the dynamics of the human brain and could result in compact representations of large neural networks. As such, SNNs have great potential for solving complicated time-dependent pattern recognition problems because of their inherent dynamic representation. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of the development of spiking neurons and SNNs, and provides insight into their evolution as the third generation neural networks.},

abstract = {Pruning a neural net consists of removing weights without degrading its performance. This is an old problem of renewed interest because of the need to compress ever larger nets so they can run in mobile devices. Pruning has been traditionally done by ranking or penalizing weights according to some criterion (such as magnitude), removing low-ranked weights and retraining the remaining ones. We formulate pruning as an optimization problem of finding the weights that minimize the loss while satisfying a pruning cost condition. We give a generic algorithm to solve this which alternates 'learning' steps that optimize a regularized, data-dependent loss and 'compression' steps that mark weights for pruning in a data-independent way. Magnitude thresholding arises naturally in the compression step, but unlike existing magnitude pruning approaches, our algorithm explores subsets of weights rather than committing irrevocably to a specific subset from the beginning. It is also able to learn automatically the best number of weights to prune in each layer of the net without incurring an exponentially costly model selection. Using a single pruning-level user parameter, we achieve state-of-the-art pruning in LeNet and ResNets of various sizes.},

Despite ongoing success, training a neural network with gradient descent can be a slow and strenuous affair. We present a simple yet faster training algorithm called Zeroth-Order Relaxed Backpropagation (ZORB). Instead of calculating gradients, ZORB uses the pseudoinverse of targets to backpropagate information. ZORB is designed to reduce the time required to train deep neural networks without penalizing performance. To illustrate the speed up, we trained a feed-forward neural network with 11 layers on MNIST and observed that ZORB converged 300 times faster than Adam while achieving a comparable error rate, without any hyperparameter tuning. We also broaden the scope of ZORB to convolutional neural networks, and apply it to subsamples of the CIFAR-10 dataset. Experiments on standard classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate ZORB's advantage over traditional backpropagation with Gradient Descent.},

Besides the ordinary Curie point near 220â, the existence of atlother transition, for example 140â in Pb(Zr95-Ti5)O_3, was confirmed. It seems reasonable to interpret these two transitions as phase changes from paraelectric state to ferroelectric one and further to antiferroelectric one. Whereas the upper transition temperature is nearly constant for these concentrations, the lower transition temperature increases with decreasing Ti concentration and both temperatures seem to coincide at pure PbZrO_3. These results suggest that PbZrO_3 may be antiferroelectric below its Curie point 220â.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs), as the basis of object detection, will play a key role in the development of future autonomous systems with full autonomy. The autonomous systems have special require- ments of real-time, energy-efficient implementations of DNNs on a power-constrained system. Two research thrusts are dedicated to performance and energy efficiency enhancement of the inference phase ofDNNs. The first one is model compression techniques while the second is efficient hardware implementation. Recent works on extremely-low-bit CNNs such as the binary neural network (BNN) and XNOR-Net replace the traditional floating point operations with binary bit operations which significantly reduces the memory bandwidth and storage requirement. However, it suffers from non- negligible accuracy loss and underutilized digital signal processing (DSP) blocks of FPGAs. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes REQ-YOLO, a resource aware, systematic weight quantization framework for object detection, considering both algorithm and hardware re- source aspects in object detection. We adopt the block-circulant matrix method and propose a heterogeneous weight quantiza- tion using Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), an effective optimization technique for general, non-convex opti- mization problems. To achieve real-time, highly-efficient imple- mentations on FPGA, we present the detailed hardware imple- mentation of block circulant matrices on CONV layers and de- velop an efficient processing element (PE) structure supporting the heterogeneous weight quantization, CONV dataflow and pipelin- ing techniques, design optimization, and a template-based auto- matic synthesis framework to optimally exploit hardware resource. Experimental results show that our proposed REQ-YOLO frame- work can significantly compress the YOLO model while introduc- ing very small accuracy degradation.

By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes, our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through the design of BoTNet, we also point out how ResNet bottleneck blocks with self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. Without any bells and whistles, BoTNet achieves 44.4% Mask AP and 49.7% Box AP on the COCO Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt evaluated on the COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of 84.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to 2.33x faster in compute time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3 hardware. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in self-attention models for vision.},

To address such problem, this paper presents a novel Learning to Prevent Forgetting (LPF) method for online mono-depth adaptation to new target domains in unsupervised manner. Instead of updating the universal parameters, LPF learns adapter modules to efficiently adjust the feature representation and distribution without losing the pre-learned knowledge in online condition. Specifically, to adapt temporal-continuous depth patterns in videos, we introduce a novel meta-learning approach to learn adapter modules by combining online adaptation process into the learning objective. To further avoid overfitting, we propose a novel temporal-consistent regularization to harmonize the gradient descent procedure at each online learning step. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method, with very limited parameters, significantly improves the estimation quality.},

Two recent continual-learning scenarios have opened new avenues of research. In meta-continual learning, the model is pre-trained to minimize catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks. In continual-meta learning, the aim is to train agents for faster remembering of previous tasks through adaptation. In their original formulations, both methods have limitations. We stand on their shoulders to propose a more general scenario, OSAKA, where an agent must quickly solve new (out-of-distribution) tasks, while also requiring fast remembering. We show that current continual learning, meta-learning, meta-continual learning, and continual-meta learning techniques fail in this new scenario. We propose Continual-MAML, an online extension of the popular MAML algorithm as a strong baseline for this scenario. We empirically show that Continual-MAML is better suited to the new scenario than the aforementioned methodologies, as well as standard continual learning and meta-learning approaches.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient and unified framework, namely ThiNet, to simultaneously accelerate and compress CNN models in both training and inference stages. We focus on the filter level pruning, i.e., the whole filter would be discarded if it is less important. Our method does not change the original network structure, thus it can be perfectly supported by any off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. We formally establish filter pruning as an optimization problem, and reveal that we need to prune filters based on statistics information computed from its next layer, not the current layer, which differentiates ThiNet from existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy, which has advanced the state-of-the-art. We also show the performance of ThiNet on ILSVRC-12 benchmark. ThiNet achieves 3.31 x FLOPs reduction and 16.63Ã compression on VGG-16, with only 0.52% top-5 accuracy drop. Similar experiments with ResNet-50 reveal that even for a compact network, ThiNet can also reduce more than half of the parameters and FLOPs, at the cost of roughly 1% top-5 accuracy drop. Moreover, the original VGG-16 model can be further pruned into a very small model with only 5.05MB model size, preserving AlexNet level accuracy but showing much stronger generalization ability.},

abstract = {Successful linguistic communication relies on a shared experience of the world, and it is this shared experience that makes utterances meaningful. Despite the incredible effectiveness of language processing models trained on text alone, today's best systems still make mistakes that arise from a failure to relate language to the physical world it describes and to the social interactions it facilitates. Natural Language Processing is a diverse field, and progress throughout its development has come from new representational theories, modeling techniques, data collection paradigms, and tasks. We posit that the present success of representation learning approaches trained on large text corpora can be deeply enriched from the parallel tradition of research on the contextual and social nature of language. In this article, we consider work on the contextual foundations of language: grounding, embodiment, and social interaction. We describe a brief history and possible progression of how contextual information can factor into our representations, with an eye towards how this integration can move the field forward and where it is currently being pioneered. We believe this framing will serve as a roadmap for truly contextual language understanding.},

abstract = {The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with high capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of large-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10 Ã or 100 Ã ? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between 'enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.},

abstract = {Graph convolutional neural networks have recently shown great potential for the task of zero-shot learning. These models are highly sample efficient as related concepts in the graph structure share statistical strength allowing generalization to new classes when faced with a lack of data. However, multi-layer architectures, which are required to propagate knowledge to distant nodes in the graph, dilute the knowledge by performing extensive Laplacian smoothing at each layer and thereby consequently decrease performance. In order to still enjoy the benefit brought by the graph structure while preventing dilution of knowledge from distant nodes, we propose a Dense Graph Propagation (DGP) module with carefully designed direct links among distant nodes. DGP allows us to exploit the hierarchical graph structure of the knowledge graph through additional connections. These connections are added based on a node's relationship to its ancestors and descendants. A weighting scheme is further used to weigh their contribution depending on the distance to the node to improve information propagation in the graph. Combined with finetuning of the representations in a two-stage training approach our method outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot learning approaches.},

abstract = {Meta-learning of shared initialization parameters has shown to be highly effective in solving few-shot learning tasks. However, extending the framework to many-shot scenarios, which may further enhance its practicality, has been relatively overlooked due to the technical difficulties of meta-learning over long chains of inner-gradient steps. In this paper, we first show that allowing the meta-learners to take a larger number of inner gradient steps better captures the structure of heterogeneous and large-scale task distributions, thus results in obtaining better initialization points. Further, in order to increase the frequency of meta-updates even with the excessively long inner-optimization trajectories, we propose to estimate the required shift of the task-specific parameters with respect to the change of the initialization parameters. By doing so, we can arbitrarily increase the frequency of meta-updates and thus greatly improve the meta-level convergence as well as the quality of the learned initializations. We validate our method on a heterogeneous set of large-scale tasks and show that the algorithm largely outperforms the previous first-order meta-learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and convergence, as well as multi-task learning and fine-tuning baselines.},

abstract = {Lifelong or continual learning remains to be a challenge for artificial neural network, as it is required to be both stable for preservation of old knowledge and plastic for acquisition of new knowledge. It is common to see previous experience get overwritten, which leads to the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, especially in the scenario of class-incremental learning (Class-IL). Recently, many lifelong learning methods have been proposed to avoid catastrophic forgetting. However, models which learn without replay of the input data, would encounter another problem which has been ignored, and we refer to it as prior information loss (PIL). In training procedure of Class-IL, as the model has no knowledge about following tasks, it would only extract features necessary for tasks learned so far, whose information is insufficient for joint classification. In this paper, our empirical results on several image datasets show that PIL limits the performance of current state-of-the-art method for Class-IL, the orthogonal weights modification (OWM) algorithm. Furthermore, we propose to combine self-supervised learning, which can provide effective representations without requiring labels, with Class-IL to partly get around this problem. Experiments show superiority of proposed method to OWM, as well as other strong baselines.},

Because of its quantitative sensitivity, inherent biological safety, and relative ease of use (i.e., with respect to cost, time, mobility, and its familiarity to a diverse population of investigators), fluorescence-based imaging techniques are being increasingly utilized in small-animal research. Moreover, there is substantial interest in the translation of novel optical techniques into the clinic, where they will prospectively aid in noninvasive and quantitative screening, disease diagnosis, and post-treatment monitoring of patients. Effective deep-tissue fluorescence imaging requires the application of exogenous NIR-emissive contrast agents. Currently, available probes fall into two major categories: organic and inorganic NIR fluorophores (NIRFs).

An exhaustive characterization study using X-ray diffraction, N2adsorption-desorption isotherms, infrared spectroscopy of pyrrole adsorbed, and temperature-programmed desorption of CO2allowed us to determine the influence of the physicochemical properties (crystallite size, surface area and porosity) and surface basicity (amount and distribution of basic sites with different strength) on the overall catalytic activity.

More in vivo like conditions are needed where bacteria can be grown and directly isolated on an electrode. While colonies can be developed from single cells on an electrode, the cells must be immobilized after being placed on the surface. Here we present a proof-of-concept immobilization approach that allows exoelectrogenic activity of cells on an electrode based on applying a layer of latex to hold bacteria on surfaces. The effectiveness of this procedure to immobilize particles was first demonstrated using fluorescent microspheres as bacterial analogs. The latex coating was then shown to not substantially affect the exoelectrogenic activity of well-developed anode biofilms in two different systems. A single layer of airbrushed coating did not reduce the voltage produced by a biofilm in a microbial fuel cell (MFC), and more easily applied dip-and-blot coating reduced voltage by only 11% in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). This latex immobilization procedure will enable future testing of single cells for exoelectrogenic activity on electrodes in BESs.},

An optimization algorithm, which can provide a schedule for smart home appliance usage, is proposed based on the mixed-integer programming technique.

Recent study has shown that a deep neural network can misclassify the data even if the input data is perturbed by an imperceptible amount. In this paper, we address the ro- bustness issue of neural networks by a novel close-loop control method from the perspective of dynamic systems. Instead of modifying the parameters in a fixed neural network architecture, a close-loop control process is added to generate con- trol signals adaptively for the perturbed or corrupted data. We connect the robust- ness of neural networks with optimal control using the geometrical information of underlying data to design the control objective. The detailed analysis shows how the embedding manifolds of state trajectory affect error estimation of the proposed method. Our approach can simultaneously maintain the performance on clean data and improve the robustness against many types of data perturbations. It can also further improve the performance of robustly trained neural networks against different perturbations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that improves the robustness of neural networks with close-loop control.},

abstract = {Assimilation of hyperspectral sounder data into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models has proven vital to generating accurate model analyses of tropospheric temperature and humidity where few conventional observations exist. Applications to storm-scale models are limited since the low temporal resolution provided by polar orbiting sensors cannot adequately sample rapidly changing environments associated with high impact weather events. To address this limitation, hyperspectral sounders have been proposed for geostationary orbiting satellites, but these have yet to be built and launched in part due to much higher engineering costs and a lack of a definite requirement for the data. This study uses an Observation System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) approach to simulate temperature and humidity profiles from a hypothetical geostationary-based sounder from a nature run of a high impact weather event on 20 May 2013. The simulated observations are then assimilated using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter approach, testing both hourly and 15 minute cycling to determine their relative effectiveness at improving the near storm environment. Results indicate that assimilating both temperature and humidity profiles reduced mid-tropospheric both mean and standard deviation of analysis and forecast errors compared to assimilating conventional observations alone. The 15 minute cycling generally produced the lowest errors while also generating the best 2â4 hour updraft helicity forecasts of ongoing convection. This study indicates the potential for significant improvement in short-term forecasting of severe storms from the assimilation of hyperspectral geostationary satellite data. However, more studies are required using improved OSSE designs encompassing multiple storm environments and additional observation types such as radar reflectivity to fully define the effectiveness of assimilating geostationary hyperspectral observations for high impact weather forecasting applications.},

abstract = {The goal of continual learning (CL) is to learn a sequence of tasks without suffering from the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. Previous work has shown that leveraging memory in the form of a replay buffer can reduce performance degradation on prior tasks. We hypothesize that forgetting can be further reduced when the model is encouraged to remember the \textit{evidence} for previously made decisions. As a first step towards exploring this hypothesis, we propose a simple novel training paradigm, called Remembering for the Right Reasons (RRR), that additionally stores visual model explanations for each example in the buffer and ensures the model has "the right reasons" for its predictions by encouraging its explanations to remain consistent with those used to make decisions at training time. Without this constraint, there is a drift in explanations and increase in forgetting as conventional continual learning algorithms learn new tasks. We demonstrate how RRR can be easily added to any memory or regularization-based approach and results in reduced forgetting, and more importantly, improved model explanations. We have evaluated our approach in the standard and few-shot settings and observed a consistent improvement across various CL approaches using different architectures and techniques to generate model explanations and demonstrated our approach showing a promising connection between explainability and continual learning.

abstract = {Conventional semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods, e.g., MixMatch, achieve great performance when both labeled and unlabeled dataset are drawn from the same distribution. However, these methods often suffer severe performance degradation in a more realistic setting, where unlabeled dataset contains out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Recent approaches mitigate the negative influence of OOD samples by filtering them out from the unlabeled data. Our studies show that it is not necessary to get rid of OOD samples during training. On the contrary, the network can benefit from them if OOD samples are properly utilized. We thoroughly study how OOD samples affect DNN training in both low- and high-dimensional spaces, where two fundamental SSL methods are considered: Pseudo Labeling (PL) and Data Augmentation based Consistency Training (DACT). Conclusion is twofold: (1) unlike PL that suffers performance degradation, DACT brings improvement to model performance; (2) the improvement is closely related to class-wise distribution gap between the labeled and the unlabeled dataset. Motivated by this observation, we further improve the model performance by bridging the gap between the labeled and the unlabeled datasets (containing OOD samples). Compared to previous algorithms paying much attention to distinguishing between ID and OOD samples, our method makes better use of OOD samples and achieves state-of-the-art results.},

abstract = {The capability of incrementally learning new tasks without forgetting old ones is a challenging problem due to catastrophic forgetting. This challenge becomes greater when novel tasks contain very few labelled training samples. Currently, most methods are dedicated to class-incremental learning and rely on sufficient training data to learn additional weights for newly added classes. Those methods cannot be easily extended to incremental regression tasks and could suffer from severe overfitting when learning few-shot novel tasks. In this study, we propose a nonparametric method in deep embedded space to tackle incremental few-shot learning problems. The knowledge about the learned tasks is compressed into a small number of quantized reference vectors. The proposed method learns new tasks sequentially by adding more reference vectors to the model using few-shot samples in each novel task. For classification problems, we employ the nearest neighbor scheme to make classification on sparsely available data and incorporate intra-class variation, less forgetting regularization and calibration of reference vectors to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. In addition, the proposed learning vector quantization (LVQ) in deep embedded space can be customized as a kernel smoother to handle incremental few-shot regression tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in incremental learning.},

However, the acquisition of labeled data for new tasks aside from existing benchmarks is both challenging and costly. Active learning can make the process of labeling new data more efficient by selecting unlabeled samples which, when labeled, are expected to improve the model the most. In this paper, we combine a novel method of active learning for object detection with an incremental learning scheme (K{\"{a}}ding et al., 2016b) to enable continuous exploration of new unlabeled datasets. We propose a set of uncertainty-based active learning metrics suitable for most object detectors. Furthermore, we present an approach to leverage class imbalances during sample selection.

It is also shown to lead to smoother level sets, allowing contour evolution without having to solve a partial differential equation. Two applications in weather analysis and forecasting demonstrate the usefulness of this proposed GDT. In particular, the dilation of sets according to the GDT allows the simplification of numerical weather forecasts and analysis into geometric objects, called MetObjects, and the generalized Hausdorff distance can be used as a forecast verification metric.},

abstract = {Stackelberg games have garnered significant attention in recent years given their deployment for real world security. Most of these systems, such as ARMOR, IRIS and GUARDS have adopted the standard game-theoretical assumption that adversaries are perfectly rational, which is standard in the game theory literature. This assumption may not hold in real-world security problems due to the bounded rationality of human adversaries, which could potentially reduce the effectiveness of these systems. In this paper, we focus on relaxing the unrealistic assumption of perfectly rational adversary in Stackelberg security games. In particular, we present new mathematical models of human adversaries' behavior, based on using two fundamental theory/method in human decision making: Prospect Theory (PT) and stochastic discrete choice model. We also provide methods for tuning the parameters of these new models. Additionally, we propose a modification of the standard quantal response based model inspired by rank-dependent expected utility theory. We then develop efficient algorithms to compute the best response of the security forces when playing against the different models of adversaries. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the new models, we conduct comprehensive experiments with human subjects using a web-based game, comparing them with models previously proposed in the literature to address the perfect rationality assumption on part of the adversary. Our experimental results show that the subjects' responses follow the assumptions of our new models more closely than the previous perfect rationality assumption. We also show that the defender strategy produced by our new stochastic discrete choice model outperform the previous leading contender for relaxing the assumption of perfect rationality. Furthermore, in a separate set of experiments, we show the benefits of our modified stochastic model (QRRU) over the standard model (QR).1{\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The physicochemical properties of the activated catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2sorption, CO2-TPD, TGA-DTG, XRF, and SEM, while the catalytic activity was tested in producing biodiesel via transesterification on palm oil with methanol under microwave conditions. The effect of microwave power, reaction time, methanol-to-oil ratio, and catalyst loading was investigated. The experimental results revealed that the catalysts exhibited a high content of CaO (99.2 wt%) with a high density of strong base sites. The catalytic testing demonstrated a remarkable enhancement for biodiesel production using microwaves compared to conventional heating. The maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters reached 96.7% under the optimal condition of reaction time of 4 min with 900 W microwave power, methanol-to-oil ratio of 18:1, and catalyst loading of 15%.

abstract = {Neural sequence models are widely used to model time-series data. Equally ubiquitous is the usage of beam search (BS) as an approximate inference algorithm to decode output sequences from these models. BS explores the search space in a greedy left-right fashion retaining only the top-B candidates - resulting in sequences that differ only slightly from each other. Producing lists of nearly identical sequences is not only computationally wasteful but also typically fails to capture the inherent ambiguity of complex AI tasks. To overcome this problem, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), an alternative to BS that decodes a list of diverse outputs by optimizing for a diversity-augmented objective. We observe that our method finds better top-1 solutions by controlling for the exploration and exploitation of the search space - implying that DBS is a better search algorithm. Moreover, these gains are achieved with minimal computational or memory over- head as compared to beam search. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we present results on image captioning, machine translation and visual question generation using both standard quantitative metrics and qualitative human studies. Further, we study the role of diversity for image-grounded language generation tasks as the complexity of the image changes. We observe that our method consistently outperforms BS and previously proposed techniques for diverse decoding from neural sequence models.},

abstract = {In recent years, neural networks have demonstrated an outstanding ability to achieve complex learning tasks across various domains. However, they suffer from the "catastrophic forgetting" problem when they face a sequence of learning tasks, where they forget the old ones as they learn new tasks. This problem is also highly related to the "stability-plasticity dilemma". The more plastic the network, the easier it can learn new tasks, but the faster it also forgets previous ones. Conversely, a stable network cannot learn new tasks as fast as a very plastic network. However, it is more reliable to preserve the knowledge it has learned from the previous tasks. Several solutions have been proposed to overcome the forgetting problem by making the neural network parameters more stable, and some of them have mentioned the significance of dropout in continual learning. However, their relationship has not been sufficiently studied yet. In this paper, we investigate this relationship and show that a stable network with dropout learns a gating mechanism such that for different tasks, different paths of the network are active. Our experiments show that the stability achieved by this implicit gating plays a very critical role in leading to performance comparable to or better than other involved continual learning algorithms to overcome catastrophic forgetting.1},

abstract = {We study the problem of learning associative memory -- a system which is able to retrieve a remembered pattern based on its distorted or incomplete version. Attractor networks provide a sound model of associative memory: patterns are stored as attractors of the network dynamics and associative retrieval is performed by running the dynamics starting from a query pattern until it converges to an attractor. In such models the dynamics are often implemented as an optimization procedure that minimizes an energy function, such as in the classical Hopfield network. In general it is difficult to derive a writing rule for a given dynamics and energy that is both compressive and fast. Thus, most research in energy-based memory has been limited either to tractable energy models not expressive enough to handle complex high-dimensional objects such as natural images, or to models that do not offer fast writing. We present a novel meta-learning approach to energy-based memory models (EBMM) that allows one to use an arbitrary neural architecture as an energy model and quickly store patterns in its weights. We demonstrate experimentally that our EBMM approach can build compressed memories for synthetic and natural data, and is capable of associative retrieval that outperforms existing memory systems in terms of the reconstruction error and compression rate.},

Although the morphological-matrix based conceptual design approaches are effective for generation of conceptual schemes, quantitative evaluation to each of the function solution principle is seldom considered, thus leading to the difficulty to identify the optimal conceptual design by combining these function solution principles. In addition, the uncertainties due to the subjective evaluations from engineers and customers in early design stage are not considered in these morphological-matrix based conceptual design approaches. To solve these problems, a systematic decision making approach is developed in this research for product conceptual design based on fuzzy morphological matrix to quantitatively evaluate function solution principles using knowledge and preferences of engineers and customers with subjective uncertainties. In this research, the morphological matrix is quantified by associating the properties of function solution principles with the information of customer preferences and product failures. Customer preferences for different function solution principles are obtained from multiple customers using fuzzy pairwise comparison (FPC). The fuzzy customer preference degree of each solution principle is then calculated by fuzzy logarithmic least square method (FLLSM). In addition, the product failure data are used to improve product reliability through fuzzy failure mode effects analysis (FMEA). Unlike the traditional FMEA, the causality relationships among failure modes of solution principles are analyzed to use failure information more effectively through constructing a directed failure causality relationship diagram (DFCRD). A fuzzy multi-objective optimization model is also developed to solve the conceptual design problem. The effectiveness of this new approach is demonstrated using a real-world application for conceptual design of a horizontal directional drilling machine (HDDM).},

We propose an LwF algorithm for multilayer feedforward neural networks in which we can adapt the number of layers of the network from the old task to the new task. To this end, we limit ourselves to convex loss functions in order to train the network in a layer-wise manner. Layer-wise convex optimization leads to low-computational complexity and provides a more interpretable understanding of the network.

We investigate the conditions in which the best ideas prevail in a stylized model of online social network, where agents have behavioral limitations in managing a heavy flow of information. We measure the relationship between the quality of an idea and its likelihood to become prevalent at the system level. We find that both information overload and limited attention contribute to a degradation in the market's discriminative power. A good tradeoff between discriminative power and diversity of information is possible according to the model. However, calibration with empirical data characterizing information load and finite attention in real social media reveals a weak correlation between quality and popularity of information. In these realistic conditions, the model predicts that low-quality information is just as likely to go viral, providing an interpretation for the high volume of misinformation we observe online.},

@article{Ramsauer2020,
abstract = {The transformer and BERT models pushed the performance on NLP tasks to new levels via their attention mechanism. We show that this attention mechanism is the update rule of a modern Hopfield network with continuous states. This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns must be traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformers learn an attention mechanism by constructing an embedding of patterns and queries into an associative space. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal in the regime of metastable states, is uniformly distributed when averaging globally, and vanishes when a fixed point is near a stored pattern. Based on the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT architectures. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging operations like the Gaussian weighting that we propose. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks that integrate Hopfield networks, that are equivalent to attention heads, outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns. We provide a new PyTorch layer called âHopfieldâ which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.

Continual learning shifts this paradigm towards networks that can continually accumulate knowledge over different tasks without the need to retrain from scratch. We focus on task incremental classification, where tasks arrive sequentially and are delineated by clear boundaries. Our main contributions concern 1) a taxonomy and extensive overview of the state-of-the-art, 2) a novel framework to continually determine the stability-plasticity trade-off of the continual learner, 3) a comprehensive experimental comparison of 11 state-of-the-art continual learning methods and 4 baselines. We empirically scrutinize method strengths and weaknesses on three benchmarks, considering Tiny Imagenet and large-scale unbalanced iNaturalist and a sequence of recognition datasets.

This is the main impact of the paper, which could have an important role in applied research. Since fuzzy k-optimal partitions with k=2,3,...,kmaxclusters are determined successively in the algorithm, it is possible to calculate corresponding validity indices for every obtained partition. The number kmaxis defined in such a way that the objective function value of optimal partition with kmaxclusters is relatively very close to the objective function value of optimal partition with (kmax-1) clusters. Before clustering, the data are normalized and afterwards several validity indices are applied to partitions of the normalized data. Very simple relationships between used validity indices on normalized and original data are given as well. Hence, the proposed algorithm is able to find optimal partitions with the most appropriate number of clusters. The algorithm is tested on numerous synthetic data sets and several real data sets from the UCI data repository.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an Effective Differential Evolution (EDE) algorithm for solving real parameter optimization problems over continuous domain. The proposed algorithm proposes a new mutation rule based on the best and the worst individuals among the entire population of a particular generation. The mutation rule is combined with the basic mutation strategy through a linear decreasing probability rule. The proposed mutation rule is shown to promote local search capability of the basic DE and to make it faster. Furthermore, a random mutation scheme and a modified Breeder Genetic Algorithm (BGA) mutation scheme are merged to avoid stagnation and/or premature convergence. Additionally, the scaling factor and crossover of DE are introduced as uniform random numbers to enrich the search behavior and to enhance the diversity of the population. The effectiveness and benefits of the proposed modifications used in EDE has been experimentally investigated. Numerical experiments on a set of bound-constrained problems have shown that the new approach is efficient, effective and robust. The comparison results between the EDE and several classical differential evolution methods and state-of-the-art parameter adaptive differential evolution variants indicate that the proposed EDE algorithm is competitive with, and in some cases superior to, other algorithms in terms of final solution quality, efficiency, convergence rate, and robustness. {\textcopyright} 2013 Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University.

abstract = {Data augmentation is a critical component of training deep learning models. Although data augmentation has been shown to significantly improve image classification, its potential has not been thoroughly investigated for object detection. Given the additional cost for annotating images for object detection, data augmentation may be of even greater importance for this computer vision task. In this work, we study the impact of data augmentation on object detection. We first demonstrate that data augmentation operations borrowed from image classification may be helpful for training detection models, but the improvement is limited. Thus, we investigate how learned, specialized data augmentation policies improve generalization performance for detection models. Importantly, these augmentation policies only affect training and leave a trained model unchanged during evaluation. Experiments on the COCO dataset indicate that an optimized data augmentation policy improves detection accuracy by more than +2.3 mAP, and allow a single inference model to achieve a state-of-the-art accuracy of 50.7 mAP. Importantly, the best policy found on COCO may be transferred unchanged to other detection datasets and models to improve predictive accuracy. For example, the best augmentation policy identified with COCO improves a strong baseline on PASCAL-VOC by +2.7 mAP. Our results also reveal that a learned augmentation policy is superior to state-of-the-art architecture regularization methods for object detection, even when considering strong baselines. Code for training with the learned policy is available online at https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/detection},

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, efforts have been made to develop performance models based on real situations for the stock preparation unit. The performance in terms of availability has been evaluated on the basis of Markov birth-death process. After that, the performance optimization using genetic algorithm is done, which gives the optimum unit availability levels for different combinations of failure and repair rates of the subsystems of stock preparation units for enhancing the overall performance of the paper plant. Findings: The effect of genetic algorithm parameters, namely number of generations, population size and crossover probability on the unit performance i.e. availability has been analyzed and discussed with the concerned paper plant management. It is found that these results are highly beneficial to the maintenance engineers for the purpose of effective maintenance planning to enhance the overall performance (availability) of the stock preparation unit of the paper plant.

The prior art in CL uses episodic memory, parameter regularization or extensible network structures to reduce interference among tasks, but in the end, all the approaches learn different tasks in a joint vector space. We believe this invariably leads to interference among different tasks. We propose to learn tasks in different (low-rank) vector subspaces that are kept orthogonal to each other in order to minimize interference. Further, to keep the gradients of different tasks coming from these subspaces orthogonal to each other, we learn isometric mappings by posing network training as an optimization problem over the Stiefel manifold. To the best of our understanding, we report, for the first time, strong results over experience-replay baseline with and without memory on standard classification benchmarks in continual learning.

As such, their applicability in a 2D-3D context is very limited, particularly where the 3D data is obtained by a LiDAR scanner. By contrast, our histogram-based approach is highly generalisable and as such, may be meaningfully applied between 2D and 3D data. Using the generalised approach, we propose salient point detectors for images, and both untextured and textured 3D data. The approach naturally allows for the detection of salient 3D points based jointly on both the geometry and texture of the scene, allowing for broader applicability. The repeatability of the feature detectors is evaluated using a range of datasets including image and LiDAR input from indoor and outdoor scenes.

abstract = {Object detection is an important process in image processing, it aims to detect instances of semantic objects of a certain class in digital images and videos. Object detection has applications in many areas of computer vision such as underwater fish detection. In this paper we present a method for preprocessing and fish localization in underwater images. We are based on a Poisson-Gauss theory, because it can accurately describe the noise present in a large variety of imaging systems. In the preprocessing step we denoise and restore the raw images. These images are split into regions utilizing the mean shift algorithm. For each region, statistical estimation is done independently in order to combine regions into objects. The method is tested under different underwater conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state of the art methods.},

Their functional properties, which include shape memory effect (SME) and superelasticity (SE), offer a particular flexibility to design many smart components. However, scientists and practitioners are still facing some restrictions in machining processes and joining techniques of NiTi SMAs to both similar and dissimilar materials. Compared to other procedures, laser welding is an economical and reliable joining technique for NiTi SMAs. Nevertheless, it is considered a challenging technique, with many obstacles still to overcome to achieve welded joints characterized by the necessary strength and the required functionalities. In this respect, the present work investigates the effects of laser welding process on the functional properties of NiTi and related alloys. Mechanical, microstructural, and metallurgical effects of the process are reported, as well. Lastly, the impact of the post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) is studied as an effective solution to improve the downsides of the laser welding process.},

abstract = {Wind speed forecasting plays a pivotal role in power dispatching and normal operations of power grids. However, it is both a difficult and challenging problem to achieve high-precision forecasting for the wind speed because the original sequence includes many nonlinear stochastic signals. The current conventional forecasting methods are more suitable for capturing linear trends, and artificial neural networks easily fall into a local optimum. This paper proposes a model that combines a denoising method with a dynamic fuzzy neural network to address the problems above. Singular spectrum analysis optimized by brain storm optimization is applied to preprocess the original wind speed data to obtain a smoother sequence, and a generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network is utilized to perform the forecasting. With a smaller and simpler structure of the neural network, the model can effectively achieve a rapid learning rate and accurate forecasting. Three experimental results, which cover 10-min, 30-min and 60-min interval wind speed time series data, demonstrate that the model can both satisfactorily approximates the actual value and be used as an effective and simple tool for the planning of smart grids.},

abstract = {Abstract The importance of understanding how confidence varies across time has been encouraged by sport confidence researchers (Vealey & Chase, 2008). The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between confidence and performance throughout an entire competitive season. Two levels of confidence consistent to team sports were analyzed. Team and coach confidence were collected through the Collective Efficacy Questionnaire for Sport (CEQS) and Coaching Efficacy Scale (CES) respectively. Two teams, women's soccer and volleyball (n=48) from a college in the western United States, completed their specific questionnaires five times throughout the season. The CEQS measured collective efficacy (team confidence) and the CES measured coaching efficacy (coach confidence) for each team. Simple linear regressions were used to determine the relationship team confidence and coaching confidence had on the success of each team. Pearson's correlation coefficients were taken to determine if team and coach confidence were connected throughout the season. Volleyball was statistically significant for both team and coach confidence at p = 0.033 and p = 0.040 respectively, with a .68 correlation coefficient. Conversely, the soccer team was not statistically significant for both team and coach confidence at p = 0.53 and p = 0.93 for each. There was, however, a strong correlation coefficient at .89 for the two levels. The findings suggest that team and coach confidence may be related and associated with the success of the team. The results also hint, through the correlation coefficients, that team and coach confidence may be connected.},

Symbolic artificial intelligence was dominant for much of the 20th century, but currently a connectionist paradigm is in the ascendant, namely machine learning with deep neural networks. However, both paradigms have strengths and weaknesses, and a significant challenge for the field today is to effect a reconciliation. A central tenet of the symbolic paradigm is that intelligence results from the manipulation of abstract compositional representations whose elements stand for objects and relations. If this is correct, then a key objective for deep learning is to develop architectures capable of discovering objects and relations in raw data, and learning how to represent them in ways that are useful for downstream processing. This short review highlights recent progress in this direction.},

In this work: (1) We first empirically show that iterative back-translation substantially improves the performance on compositional generalization benchmarks (CFQ and SCAN).

However, there is an inherent trade-off to effectively learning new concepts without catastrophic forgetting of previous ones. To alleviate this issue, it has been proposed to keep around a few examples of the previous concepts but the effectiveness of this approach heavily depends on the representativeness of these examples. This paper proposes a novel and automatic framework we call mnemonics, where we parameterize exemplars and make them optimizable in an end-to-end manner. We train the framework through bilevel optimizations, i.e., model-level and exemplar-level. We conduct extensive experiments on three MCIL benchmarks, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset and ImageNet, and show that using mnemonics exemplars can surpass the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Interestingly and quite intriguingly, the mnemonics exemplars tend to be on the boundaries between different classes.},

It aims at embedding augmented versions of the same sample close to each other while trying to push away embeddings from different samples. This paper provides an extensive review of self-supervised methods that follow the contrastive approach. The work explains commonly used pretext tasks in a contrastive learning setup, followed by different architectures that have been proposed so far. Next, we present a performance comparison of different methods for multiple downstream tasks such as image classification, object detection, and action recognition. Finally, we conclude with the limitations of the current methods and the need for further techniques and future directions to make meaningful progress.},

Deep networks are able to sequentially map portions of each layer's input-space to the same output. In this way, deep models compute functions that react equally to complicated patterns of different inputs. The compositional structure of these functions enables them to re-use pieces of computation exponentially often in terms of the network's depth. This paper investigates the complexity of such compositional maps and contributes new theoretical results regarding the advantage of depth for neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In particular, our analysis is not specific to a single family of models, and as an example, we employ it for rectifier and maxout networks. We improve complexity bounds from pre-existing work and investigate the behavior of units in higher layer.},

In order to succeed at this task, context encoders need to both understand the content of the entire image, as well as produce a plausible hypothesis for the missing part(s). When training context encoders, we have experimented with both a standard pixel-wise reconstruction loss, as well as a reconstruction plus an adversarial loss. The latter produces much sharper results because it can better handle multiple modes in the output. We found that a context encoder learns a representation that captures not just appearance but also the semantics of visual structures. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned features for CNN pre-training on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, context encoders can be used for semantic inpainting tasks, either stand-alone or as initialization for non-parametric methods.},

abstract = {Images are uploaded to the Internet over time which makes concept drifting and distribution change in semantic classes unavoidable. Current hashing methods being trained using a given static database may not be suitable for nonstationary semantic image retrieval problems. Moreover, directly retraining a whole hash table to update knowledge coming from new arriving image data may not be efficient. Therefore, this paper proposes a new incremental hash-bit learning method. At the arrival of new data, hash bits are selected from both existing and newly trained hash bits by an iterative maximization of a 3-component objective function. This objective function is also used to weight selected hash bits to re-rank retrieved images for better semantic image retrieval results. The three components evaluate a hash bit in three different angles: 1) information preservation; 2) partition balancing; and 3) bit angular difference. The proposed method combines knowledge retained from previously trained hash bits and new semantic knowledge learned from the new data by training new hash bits. In comparison to table-based incremental hashing, the proposed method automatically adjusts the number of bits from old data and new data according to the concept drifting in the given data via the maximization of the objective function. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing stationary hashing methods, table-based incremental hashing, and online hashing methods in 15 different simulated nonstationary data environments.},

In this paper we point out the differences between multi-task and single-incremental-task scenarios and show that well-known approaches such as LWF, EWC and SI are not ideal for incremental task scenarios. A new approach, denoted as AR1, combining architectural and regularization strategies is then specifically proposed. AR1 overhead (in terms of memory and computation) is very small thus making it suitable for online learning.

abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the biasâvariance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The biasâvariance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This âdouble-descentâ curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped biasâvariance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

abstract = {Recent studies on catastrophic forgetting during sequential learning typically focus on fixing the accuracy of the predictions for a previously learned task. In this paper we argue that the outputs of neural networks are subject to rapid changes when learning a new data distribution, and networks that appear to "forget" everything still contain useful representation towards previous tasks. Instead of enforcing the output accuracy to stay the same, we propose to reduce the effect of catastrophic forgetting on the representation level, as the output layer can be quickly recovered later with a small number of examples. Towards this goal, we propose an experimental setup that measures the amount of representational forgetting, and develop a novel meta-learning algorithm to overcome this issue. The proposed meta-learner produces weight updates of a sequential learning network, mimicking a multi-task teacher network's representation. We show that our meta-learner can improve its learned representations on new tasks, while maintaining a good representation for old tasks.},

The effects of catalyst preparation conditions (such as the loading of K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> on the CB and the calcination temperature), reaction conditions (such as reaction time, methanol/oil molar ratio and catalyst loading) and the catalyst reusability were studied in detail. The experimental results revealed that the highest biodiesel yield of 96.4% was obtained using the 30K/HAP-600 catalyst under the optimum reaction condition (reaction time of 1.5 h, catalyst loading of 8 wt.% and methanol/oil molar ratio of 9:1) due to its highest total basicity. Moreover, after reused for more than 8 cycles, the catalyst can still possess a rather high biodiesel yield (above 90%). A little deactivation was found due to K<sup>+</sup> ions leaching to the product.},

abstract = {The ability to predict the activities of users is an important one for recommender systems and analyses of social media. User activities can be represented in terms of relationships involving three or more things (e.g. when a user tags items on a webpage or tweets about a location he or she visited). Such relationships can be represented as a tensor, and tensor factorization is becoming an increasingly important means for predicting users' possible activities. However, the prediction accuracy of factorization is poor for ambiguous and/or sparsely observed objects. Our solution, Semantic Sensitive Tensor Factorization (SSTF), incorporates the semantics expressed by an object vocabulary or taxonomy into the tensor factorization. SSTF first links objects to classes in the vocabulary (taxonomy) and resolves the ambiguities of objects that may have several meanings. Next, it lifts sparsely observed objects to their classes to create augmented tensors. Then, it factorizes the original tensor and augmented tensors simultaneously. Since it shares semantic knowledge during the factorization, it can resolve the sparsity problem. Furthermore, as a result of the natural use of semantic information in tensor factorization, SSTF can combine heterogeneous and unbalanced datasets from different Linked Open Data sources. We implemented SSTF in the Bayesian probabilistic tensor factorization framework. Experiments on publicly available large-scale datasets using vocabularies from linked open data and a taxonomy from WordNet show that SSTF has up to 12% higher accuracy in comparison with state-of-the-art tensor factorization methods.},

The role of size in several visual reasoning tasks has been thoroughly explored in human perception and cognition. However, the impact of the information about sizes of objects is yet to be determined in AI. We postulate that this is mainly attributed to the lack of a comprehensive repository of size information. In this paper, we introduce a method to automatically infer object sizes, leveraging visual and textual information from web. By maximizing the joint likelihood of textual and visual observations, our method learns reliable relative size estimates, with no explicit human supervision. We introduce the relative size dataset and show that our method outperforms competitive textual and visual baselines in reasoning about size comparisons.},

abstract = {The deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in many real world applications is largely hindered by their high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel learning scheme for CNNs to simultaneously 1) reduce the model size; 2) decrease the run-time memory footprint; and 3) lower the number of computing operations, without compromising accuracy. This is achieved by enforcing channel-level sparsity in the network in a simple but effective way. Different from many existing approaches, the proposed method directly applies to modern CNN architectures, introduces minimum overhead to the training process, and requires no special software/hardware accelerators for the resulting models. We call our approach network slimming, which takes wide and large networks as input models, but during training insignificant channels are automatically identified and pruned afterwards, yielding thin and compact models with comparable accuracy. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several state-of-the-art CNN models, including VGGNet, ResNet and DenseNet, on various image classification datasets. For VGGNet, a multi-pass version of network slimming gives a 20Ã reduction in model size and a 5Ã reduction in computing operations.},

Rehearsing the neural network with the training data of the previous task can protect the network from catastrophic forgetting. Since rehearsing requires the storage of entire previous data, Pseudo rehearsal was proposed, where samples belonging to the previous data are generated synthetically for rehearsal. In an image classification setting, while current techniques try to generate synthetic data that is photo-realistic, we demonstrated that Neural networks can be rehearsed on data that is not photo-realistic and still achieve good retention of the previous task. We also demonstrated that forgoing the constraint of having photo realism in the generated data can result in a significant reduction in the consumption of computational and memory resources for pseudo rehearsal.},

In particular, enforcing a smooth output change while presenting temporally-closed frames from video sequences, proved to be an effective strategy. In this paper we prove the efficacy of temporal coherence for semi-supervised incremental tuning. We show that a deep architecture, just mildly trained in a supervised manner, can progressively improve its classification accuracy, if exposed to video sequences of unlabeled data. The extent to which, in some cases, a semi-supervised tuning allows to improve classification accuracy (approaching the supervised one) is somewhat surprising.

abstract = {Although deep learning approaches have stood out in recent years due to their state-of-the-art results, they continue to suffer from catastrophic forgetting, a dramatic decrease in overall performance when training with new classes added incrementally. This is due to current neural network architectures requiring the entire dataset, consisting of all the samples from the old as well as the new classes, to update the modelâa requirement that becomes easily unsustainable as the number of classes grows. We address this issue with our approach to learn deep neural networks incrementally, using new data and only a small exemplar set corresponding to samples from the old classes. This is based on a loss composed of a distillation measure to retain the knowledge acquired from the old classes, and a cross-entropy loss to learn the new classes. Our incremental training is achieved while keeping the entire framework end-to-end, i.e., learning the data representation and the classifier jointly, unlike recent methods with no such guarantees. We evaluate our method extensively on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) image classification datasets, and show state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract = {The success of CNNs in various applications is accompanied by a significant increase in the computation and parameter storage costs. Recent efforts toward reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers without hurting original accuracy. However, magnitude-based pruning of weights reduces a significant number of parameters from the fully connected layers and may not adequately reduce the computation costs in the convolutional layers due to irregular sparsity in the pruned networks. We present an acceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy. By removing whole filters in the network together with their connecting feature maps, the computation costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to pruning weights, this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, it does not need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing efficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even simple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to 34% and ResNet-110 by up to 38% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the original accuracy by retraining the networks.},

abstract = {Neurons in real brains are enormously complex computational units. Among other things, they're responsible for transforming inbound electro-chemical vectors into outbound action potentials, updating the strengths of intermediate synapses, regulating their own internal states, and modulating the behavior of other nearby neurons. One could argue that these cells are the only things exhibiting any semblance of real intelligence. It is odd, therefore, that the machine learning community has, for so long, relied upon the assumption that this complexity can be reduced to a simple sum and fire operation. We ask, might there be some benefit to substantially increasing the computational power of individual neurons in artificial systems? To answer this question, we introduce Deep Artificial Neurons (DANs), which are themselves realized as deep neural networks. Conceptually, we embed DANs inside each node of a traditional neural network, and we connect these neurons at multiple synaptic sites, thereby vectorizing the connections between pairs of cells. We demonstrate that it is possible to meta-learn a single parameter vector, which we dub a neuronal phenotype, shared by all DANs in the network, which facilitates a meta-objective during deployment. Here, we isolate continual learning as our meta-objective, and we show that a suitable neuronal phenotype can endow a single network with an innate ability to update its synapses with minimal forgetting, using standard backpropagation, without experience replay, nor separate wake/sleep phases. We demonstrate this ability on sequential non-linear regression tasks.},

We clarify its relationships with most existing frameworks such as cross-entropy, information bottleneck, information gain, contractive and contrastive learning, and provide theoretical guarantees for learning diverse and discriminative features. The coding rate can be accurately computed from finite samples of degenerate subspace-like distributions and can learn intrinsic representations in supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised settings in a unified manner. Empirically, the representations learned using this principle alone are significantly more robust to label corruptions in classification than those using cross-entropy, and can lead to state-of-the-art results in clustering mixed data from self-learned invariant features.},

However, there are fundamental differences in data sizes, features and task specifications between natural image classification and the target medical tasks, and there is little understanding of the effects of transfer. In this paper, we explore properties of transfer learning for medical imaging. A performance evaluation on two large scale medical imaging tasks shows that surprisingly, transfer offers little benefit to performance, and simple, lightweight models can perform comparably to ImageNet architectures. Investigating the learned representations and features, we find that some of the differences from transfer learning are due to the over-parametrization of standard models rather than sophisticated feature reuse. We isolate where useful feature reuse occurs, and outline the implications for more efficient model exploration. We also explore feature independent benefits of transfer arising from weight scalings.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are indispensable to state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms. However, they are still rarely deployed on battery-powered mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearable gadgets, where vision algorithms can enable many revolutionary real-world applications. The key limiting factor is the high energy consumption of CNN processing due to its high computational complexity. While there are many previous efforts that try to reduce the CNN model size or the amount of computation, we find that they do not necessarily result in lower energy consumption. Therefore, these targets do not serve as a good metric for energy cost estimation. To close the gap between CNN design and energy consumption optimization, we propose an energy-aware pruning algorithm for CNNs that directly uses the energy consumption of a CNN to guide the pruning process. The energy estimation methodology uses parameters extrapolated from actual hardware measurements. The proposed layer-by-layer pruning algorithm also prunes more aggressively than previously proposed pruning methods by minimizing the error in the output feature maps instead of the filter weights. For each layer, the weights are first pruned and then locally fine-tuned with a closed-form least-square solution to quickly restore the accuracy. After all layers are pruned, the entire network is globally fine-tuned using back-propagation. With the proposed pruning method, the energy consumption of AlexNet and GoogLeNet is reduced by 3.7Ã and 1.6Ã, respectively, with less than 1% top-5 accuracy loss. We also show that reducing the number of target classes in AlexNet greatly decreases the number of weights, but has a limited impact on energy consumption.},

abstract = {Transesterification of palm kernel oil (PKO) with methanol over various natural calciums, including limestone calcite, cuttlebone, dolomite, hydroxyapatite, and dicalcium phosphate, has been investigated at 60 Â°C and 1 atm. The study showed that dolomite, mainly consisting of CaCO3 and MgCO3, is the most active catalyst. The calcination temperature largely affected the physicochemical properties, as evidenced by N2 adsorption-desorption measurement, TGA, SEM and XRD, and the transesterification performance of the resultant catalysts. It was found that the calcination of dolomite at 800 Â°C resulted in a highly active mixed oxide. CaO was suggested to be the catalytically active site responsible for the methyl ester formation. Under the suitable reaction conditions, the amount of dolomite calcined at 800 Â°C = 6 wt.% based on the weight of oil, the methanol/oil molar ratio = 30, and the reaction time = 3 h, the methyl ester content of 98.0% can be achieved. The calcined dolomite can be reused many times. The analyses of some important fuel properties indicated that the biodiesel produced had the properties that meet the standard of biodiesel and diesel fuel issued by the Department of Energy Business, Ministry of Energy, Thailand. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

However, recent advances in continual learning are restricted to supervised continual learning (SCL) scenarios. Consequently, they are not scalable to real-world applications where the data distribution is often biased and unannotated. In this work, we focus on unsupervised continual learning (UCL), where we learn the feature representations on an unlabelled sequence of tasks and show that reliance on annotated data is not necessary for continual learning. We conduct a systematic study analyzing the learned feature representations and show that unsupervised visual representations are surprisingly more robust to catastrophic forgetting, consistently achieve better performance, and generalize better to out-of-distribution tasks than SCL. Furthermore, we find that UCL achieves a smoother loss landscape through qualitative analysis of the learned representations and learns meaningful feature representations. Additionally, we propose Lifelong Unsupervised Mixup (LUMP), a simple yet effective technique that leverages the interpolation between the current task and previous tasks' instances to alleviate catastrophic forgetting for unsupervised representations.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been growing interest in reducing energy consumption and emissions of manufacturing systems. Except for adopting new equipment or techniques, scheduling is crucial to reduce the total energy consumption of manufacturing systems. This paper focuses on the scheduling problem for flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption, and proposes a novel scheduling algorithm for FMSs based on Petri net models and genetic algorithm. Considering that energy consumptions in different states of resources are different, this paper takes two ways for calculating total energy consumptions. In the proposed genetic algorithm, a potential schedule is represented by a chromosome consisting of route selection and operation sequence. Crossover and mutation operations are performed on the operation sequence to guarantee the population diversity. For deadlock-prone FMSs, not all chromosomes can be directly decoded to a feasible schedule. To check the feasibility of chromosomes and convert infeasible chromosomes into feasible ones, a repair algorithm is developed with the help of the deadlock avoidance policy. Experiment results on a typical FMS and an industrial stamping system are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed scheduling algorithm.},

The ability to outline the healthy vital tissues to be carefully navigated with transection while an intraoperative surgery procedure is performed sets up a necessary and under-researched goal. To achieve the aforementioned objectives, there is a need to optimize design considerations in order to not only obtain an effective imaging agent but to also achieve attributes like favorable water solubility, biocompatibility, high molecular brightness, and a tissue specific targeting approach. The emergence of near infra-red fluorescence (NIRF) light for tissue scale imaging owes to the provision of highly specific images of the target organ. The special characteristics of near infra-red window such as minimal auto-fluorescence, low light scattering, and absorption of biomolecules in tissue converge to form an attractive modality for cancer imaging. Imparting molecular fluorescence as an exogenous contrast agent is the most beneficial attribute of NIRF light as a clinical imaging technology. Additionally, many such agents also display therapeutic potentials as photo-thermal agents, thus meeting the dual purpose of imaging and therapy. Here, we primarily discuss molecular imaging and therapeutic potentials of two such classes of materials, i.e., inorganic NIR dyes and metallic gold nanoparticle based materials.},

To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a sweet spot of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural networks performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks.

Motivated by this limitation, we identify a set of key designs -- ego- and neighbor-embedding separation, higher-order neighborhoods, and combination of intermediate representations -- that boost learning from the graph structure under heterophily. We combine them into a graph neural network, H2GCN, which we use as the base method to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the identified designs. Going beyond the traditional benchmarks with strong homophily, our empirical analysis shows that the identified designs increase the accuracy of GNNs by up to 40% and 27% over models without them on synthetic and real networks with heterophily, respectively, and yield competitive performance under homophily.},

abstract = {Modern deep learning methods have achieved great success in machine learning and computer vision fields by learning a set of pre-defined datasets. Howerver, these methods perform unsatisfactorily when applied into real-world situations. The reason of this phenomenon is that learning new tasks leads the trained model quickly forget the knowledge of old tasks, which is referred to as catastrophic forgetting. Current state-of-the-art incremental learning methods tackle catastrophic forgetting problem in traditional classification networks and ignore the problem existing in embedding networks, which are the basic networks for image retrieval, face recognition, zero-shot learning, etc. Different from traditional incremental classification networks, the semantic gap between the embedding spaces of two adjacent tasks is the main challenge for embedding networks under incremental learning setting. Thus, we propose a novel class-incremental method for embedding network, named as zero-shot translation class-incremental method (ZSTCI), which leverages zero-shot translation to estimate and compensate the semantic gap without any exemplars. Then, we try to learn a unified representation for two adjacent tasks in sequential learning process, which captures the relationships of previous classes and current classes precisely. In addition, ZSTCI can easily be combined with existing regularization-based incremental learning methods to further improve performance of embedding networks. We conduct extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011 and CIFAR100, and the experiment results prove the effectiveness of our method. The code of our method has been released.},

abstract = {Continual learning (CL) incrementally learns a sequence of tasks while solving the catastrophic forgetting (CF) problem. Existing methods mainly try to deal with CF directly. In this paper, we propose to avoid CF by considering the features of each class holistically rather than only the discriminative information for classifying the classes seen so far. This latter approach is prone to CF because the discriminative informa- tion for old classes may not be sufficiently discriminative for the new class to be learned. Consequently, in learning each new task, the network parameters for previous tasks have to be revised, which causes CF. With the holistic consideration, after adding new tasks, the system can still do well for previous tasks. The proposed technique is called Per-class Continual Learning (PCL). PCL has two key novelties. (1) It proposes a one-class learning based technique for CL, which considers features of each class holistically and represents a new ap- proach to solving the CL problem. (2) It proposes a method to extract discriminative information after training to further improve the accuracy. Empirical evaluation shows that PCL markedly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines for one or more classes per task. More tasks also result in more gains.},

WS2 Q-switched fiber laser generates the most stable pulse trains compared to other 3 fiber lasers.

Deep learning approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning classes incrementally, while most incremental learning approaches require a large amount of training data per class. We examine the problem of incremental learning using only a few training examples, referred to as Few-Shot Incremental Learning (FSIL). To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach inspired by the concept learning model of the hippocampus and the neocortex that represents each image class as centroids and does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our approach on three class-incremental learning benchmarks: Caltech-101, CUBS-200-2011 and CIFAR-100 for incremental and few-shot incremental learning and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of classification accuracy over all learned classes.},

A possible influence of practice conditions was observed when members of the body conditioning class reported significant increases in fatigue, but no other mood changes.

abstract = {We propose using new weighted operators in fuzzy time series to forecast the future performance of stock market indices. Based on the chronological sequence of weights associated with the original fuzzy logical relationships, we define both chronological-order and trend-order weights, and incorporate our proposals for the ex-post forecast into the classical modeling approach of fuzzy time series. These modifications for the assignation of weights affect the forecasting process, because we use jumps as technical indicators to predict stock trends, and additionally, they provide a trapezoidal fuzzy number as a forecast of the future performance of the stock index value. Working with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers allows us to analyze both the expected value and the ambiguity of the future behavior of the stock index, using a possibilistic interval-valued mean approach. Therefore, using fuzzy logic more useful information is provided to the decision analyst, which should be appropriate in a financial context. We analyze the effectiveness of our approach with respect to other weighted fuzzy time series methods using trading data sets from the Taiwan Stock Index (TAIEX), the Japanese NIKKEI Index, the German Stock Index (DAX) and the Spanish Stock Index (IBEX35). The comparative results indicate the better accuracy of our procedure for point-wise one-step ahead forecasts.},

abstract = {Problem statement: Today, inventory management is considered to be an important field in Supply chain management. Once the efficient and effective management of inventory is carried out throughout the supply chain, service provided to the customer ultimately gets enhanced. Hence, to ensure minimal cost for the supply chain, the determination of the level of inventory to be held at various levels in a supply chain is unavoidable. Minimizing the total supply chain cost refers to the reduction of holding and shortage cost in the entire supply chain. Efficient inventory management is a complex process which entails the management of the inventory in the whole supply chain and getting the final solution as an optimal one. In other words, during the process of supply chain management, the stock level at each member of the supply chain should account to minimum total supply chain cost. The dynamic nature of the excess stock level and shortage level over all the periods is a serious issue when implementation was considered. In addition, consideration of multiple products leads to very complex inventory management process. The complexity of the problem increases when more distribution centers and agents were involved. Approach: In present research, the issues of inventory management had been focused and a novel approach based on genetic algorithm had been proposed in which the most probable excess stock level and shortage level required for inventory optimization in the supply chain is distinctively determined so as to achieve minimum total supply chain cost. Results: The analysis provided us with an inventory level that made a remarkable contribution towards the increase of supply chain cost. We predicted the optimal inventory levels in all the supply chain members with the aid of these levels. Conclusion: We concluded that it is possible to minimize the supply chain cost by maintaining the optimal stock levels that we predicted from the inventory analysis. This will make the inventory management further effective and efficient thereby enhancing the customer servicing levels.

abstract = {Deep learning approaches are nowadays ubiquitously used to tackle computer vision tasks such as semantic segmentation, requiring large datasets and substantial computational power. Continual learning for semantic segmentation (CSS) is an emerging trend that consists in updating an old model by sequentially adding new classes. However, continual learning methods are usually prone to catastrophic forgetting. This issue is further aggravated in CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes. Our approach, called PLOP, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in existing CSS scenarios, as well as in newly proposed challenging benchmarks.},

Our work relaxes the static assumptions of these representations to tackle the incremental knowledge graph embedding problem by leveraging principles of a range of continual learning methods. Through an experimental evaluation with several knowledge graphs and embedding representations, we provide insights about trade-offs for practitioners to match a semantics-driven robotics application to a suitable continual knowledge graph embedding method.},

abstract = {Hybrid microgrids that use renewable energy sources can improve energy security and islanding time while reducing costs. One potential beneficiary of these systems is the U.S. military, which can seek to improve energy security when operating in isolated areas by using a microgrid rather than relying on a fragile (or nonexistent) commercial network. Renewable energy sources can be intermittent and unpredictable, making it difficult to plan operations of a microgrid. We describe a scenario-robust mixed-integer linear program designed to utilize ensemble weather forecasts to improve the performance of a hybrid microgrid containing both renewable and traditional power sources. We exercise our model to quantify the benefit of using ensemble weather forecasts, and we predict the optimal performance of a hypothetical grid containing wind turbines by using simulated realistic weather forecast scenarios based on data. Because forecast quality degrades with lead time, we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine which planning horizon results in the best performance. Our results show that, for day-ahead planning, longer planning horizons outperform shorter planning horizons in terms of cost of operations, but this improvement diminishes as the planning horizon lengthens.},

abstract = {While the rapid development of information technology has made easy to store and access the huge amount of data, it also brings another problem, that of how to extract potentially useful knowledge not only in an efficient way but also in a way that could be easily understandable by humans. One of the solutions to this problem is linguistic summarization, aim of which is to generate explicit and concise summaries from data that is more compatible with human cognitive mechanism. The most crucial step in linguistic summarization is certainly the evaluation of linguistic summaries since they are the most important element of fuzzy rule based systems commonly used in expert systems and intelligent systems. Therefore, the selection of appropriate method for evaluating linguistic summaries in sense of different views such as quality, quantity, relevance and simplicity becomes vital. The aim of this paper is to review the state of art on linguistic summarization in the framework of fuzzy sets, focusing on the methods for evaluating linguistic summaries and the current applications. A taxonomy is proposed to identify the existing methods depending on the type of fuzzy sets (i.e., type-1 fuzzy set and type-2 fuzzy set) and the type of cardinalities (i.e., scalar cardinality and fuzzy cardinality). The recent studies on linguistic summarization are also presented to give a comprehensive framework for the future directions. The paper ends with conclusions, addressing some important issues and open questions which can be subject for future research.},

Multi- plicative interaction layers as primitive operations have a long-established presence in the literature, though this often not emphasized and thus under-appreciated. We begin by showing that such layers strictly enrich the representable function classes of neural networks. We conjecture that multiplicative interactions offer a particularly powerful inductive bias when fusing multiple streams ofinformation or when conditional computation is required. We therefore argue that they should be considered in many situation where multiple compute or information paths need to be combined, in place of the simple and oft-used concatenation operation. Finally, we back up our claims and demonstrate the potential of multiplicative interactions by applying them in large-scale complex RL and sequence modelling tasks, where their use allows us to deliver state-of-the-art results, and thereby provides new evidence in support of multiplicative interactions playing a more prominent role when designing new neural network architectures.},

abstract = {Pre-training is a dominant paradigm in computer vision. For example, supervised ImageNet pre-training is commonly used to initialize the backbones of object detection and segmentation models. He et al. [1], however, show a surprising result that ImageNet pre-training has limited impact on COCO object detection. Here we investigate self-training as another method to utilize additional data on the same setup and contrast it against ImageNet pre-training. Our study reveals the generality and flexibility of self-training with three additional insights: 1) stronger data augmentation and more labeled data further diminish the value of pre-training, 2) unlike pre-training, self-training is always helpful when using stronger data augmentation, in both low-data and high-data regimes, and 3) in the case that pre-training is helpful, self-training improves upon pre-training. For example, on the COCO object detection dataset, pre-training benefits when we use one fifth of the labeled data, and hurts accuracy when we use all labeled data. Self-training, on the other hand, shows positive improvements from +1.3 to +3.4AP across all dataset sizes. In other words, self-training works well exactly on the same setup that pre-training does not work (using ImageNet to help COCO). On the PASCAL segmentation dataset, which is a much smaller dataset than COCO, though pre-training does help significantly, self-training improves upon the pre-trained model. On COCO object detection, we achieve 54.3AP, an improvement of +1.5AP over the strongest SpineNet model. On PASCAL segmentation, we achieve 90.5 mIOU, an improvement of +1.5% mIOU over the previous state-of-the-art result by DeepLabv3+.},

Our method performs favorably compared to commonly used feature extraction and fine-tuning adaption techniques and performs similarly to multitask learning that uses original task data we assume unavailable. A more surprising observation is that Learning without Forgetting may be able to replace fine-tuning with similar old and new task datasets for improved new task performance.},

abstract = {The optical touch pointer (OTP), a fluorescence spectroscopy based system, assists brain surgeons during guided brain tumor resection in patients with glioblastoma multi- forme (GBM). After recording and analyzing the autofluorescence spectrum of the tis- sue, it is possible to distinguish malignant from healthy brain tissue. A challenge during the intraoperative measurements is the interference of blood. If it gets in contact with the laser pointer, the blood blocks the light transmission to and from the tissue. The purpos- es of the project were to study and categorize patterns of blood interference and to present possible solutions to avoid signal blocking by blood. To measure fluorescence and reflection two devices were used respectively, the OTP which has a spectrometer and a blue laser, and the diffused reflection spectroscopy sys- tem (DRS) which has a spectrometer and a white light source. Both operate indepen- dently from each other and are connected to a fiber optical probe. A similar scenario to the one in the operation theater was simulated in the lab. Fluorescence and diffuse ref- lection measurements with and without blood were realized on skin and on two different plastic fluorescent standards. The results were analyzed with the aid of MatLAB, and compared with data collected in the hospital during brain tumor resection. The highest autofluorescence of brain tissue and skin is reached at approximately 506 nm. Although skin and both plastic standards have different optical properties re- garding color or rather fluorescence, all of them presented very similar curves when blood on them blocked partially or completely the light transmission. A blood layer of more than 0.1 mm thickness blocks the blue laser light. Blood absorption happens at 541 and 577 nm due to oxy-hemoglobin (HbO2) in both liquid and dried blood. When the fluorescence spectrum is available but weak, the reflection spectrum contains two dips (traces of HbO2 at 541 and 577 nm). In brain there were cases in which light absorption occurred additionally at other wavelengths than the absorption peaks of deoxy- hemoglobin (Hb) and HbO2. Blood interference during the OP can be prevented if the probe rests in a saline solution after every measurement. In this way the fresh blood sticking on the probe dissolves in the solution. For dried or coagulated blood, additional manual cleansing is needed.},

abstract = {Robotic vision is a field where continual learning can play a significant role. An embodied agent operating in a complex environment subject to frequent and unpredictable changes is required to learn and adapt continuously. In the context of object recognition, for example, a robot should be able to learn (without forgetting) objects of never before seen classes as well as improving its recognition capabilities as new instances of already known classes are discovered. Ideally, continual learning should be triggered by the availability of short videos of single objects and performed on-line on on-board hardware with fine-grained updates. In this paper, we introduce a novel continual learning protocol based on the CORe50 benchmark and propose two rehearsal-free continual learning techniques, CWRâ and AR1â, that can learn effectively even in the challenging case of nearly 400 small non-i.i.d. incremental batches. In particular, our experiments show that AR1â can outperform other state-of-the-art rehearsal-free techniques by more than 15% accuracy in some cases, with a very light and constant computational and memory overhead across training batches.},

Most research on robustness focuses on synthetic image perturbations (noise, simulated weather artifacts, adversarial examples, etc.), which leaves open how robustness on synthetic distribution shift relates to distribution shift arising in real data. Informed by an evaluation of 204 ImageNet models in 213 different test conditions, we find that there is often little to no transfer of robustness from current synthetic to natural distribution shift. Moreover, most current techniques provide no robustness to the natural distribution shifts in our testbed. The main exception is training on larger and more diverse datasets, which in multiple cases increases robustness, but is still far from closing the performance gaps. Our results indicate that distribution shifts arising in real data are currently an open research problem.

abstract = {Continual learning has been a major problem in the deep learning community, where the main challenge is how to effectively learn a series of newly arriving tasks without forgetting the knowledge of previous tasks. Initiated by Learning with- out Forgetting (LwF), many of the existing works report that knowledge distillation is effective to preserve the previous knowledge, and hence they commonly use a soft label for the old task, namely a knowledge distillation (KD) loss, together with a class label for the new task, namely a cross entropy (CE) loss, to form a composite loss for a single neural network. However, this approach suffers from learning the knowledge by a CE loss as a KD loss often more strongly influences the objective function when they are in a competitive situation within a single network. This could be a critical problem par- ticularly in a class incremental scenario, where the knowledge across tasks as well as within the new task, both of which can only be acquired by a CE loss, is essentially learned due to the existence of a unified classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method, called Split-and-Bridge, which can successfully address the above problem by partially splitting a neural network into two partitions for training the new task separated from the old task and re-connecting them for learning the knowledge across tasks. In our thorough exper- imental analysis, our Split-and-Bridge method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in KD-based continual learning.},

Neural networks are able to process tasks like image recognition (better than humans) but in memory aspects are still limited (by attention mechanism, size).

The Solution is to use large external memory. Still, it poses many challenges like, how to train neural networks for discrete memory representation, how to describe long term dependencies in sequential data etc. Most prominent neural architectures for such tasks are Memory networks: inference components combined with long term memory and Neural Turing Machines: neural networks using external memory resources. Also, additional techniques like attention mechanism, end to end gradient descent on discrete memory representation are needed to support these solutions. Preliminary results of above neural architectures on simple algorithms (sorting, copying) and Question Answering (based on story, dialogs) application are comparable with the state of the art. In this paper, I explain these architectures (in general), the additional techniques used and the results of their application.},

We argue that designing attention mechanism for recognizing multiple seen and unseen labels in an image is a non-Trivial task as there is no training signal to localize unseen labels and an image only contains a few present labels that need attentions out of thousands of possible labels. Therefore, instead of generating attentions for unseen labels which have unknown behaviors and could focus on irrelevant regions due to the lack of any training sample, we let the unseen labels select among a set of shared attentions which are trained to be label-Agnostic and to focus on only relevant/foreground regions through our novel loss. Finally, we learn a compatibility function to distinguish labels based on the selected attention. We further propose a novel loss function that consists of three components guiding the attention to focus on diverse and relevant image regions while utilizing all attention features. By extensive experiments, we show that our method improves the state of the art by 2.9% and 1.4% F1 score on the NUS-WIDE and the large scale Open Images datasets, respectively.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) often suffer from "catastrophic forgetting" during incremental learning (IL) - an abrupt degradation of performance on the original set of classes when the training objective is adapted to a newly added set of classes. Existing IL approaches tend to produce a model that is biased towards either the old classes or new classes, unless with the help of exemplars of the old data. To address this issue, we propose a class-incremental learning paradigm called Deep Model Consolidation (DMC), which works well even when the original training data is not available. The idea is to first train a separate model only for the new classes, and then combine the two individual models trained on data of two distinct set of classes (old classes and new classes) via a novel double distillation training objective. The two existing models are consolidated by exploiting publicly available unlabeled auxiliary data. This overcomes the potential difficulties due to unavailability of original training data. Compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, DMC demonstrates significantly better performance in image classification (CIFAR-100 and CUB-200) and object detection (PASCAL VOC 2007) in the single-headed IL setting.},

On the other hand, deep learning networks are ill-equipped for incremental learning. When a well-trained network is adapted to new categories, its performance on the old categories will dramatically degrade. To address this problem, incremental learning methods have been explored which preserve the old knowledge of deep learning models. However, the state-of-the-art incremental object detector employs an external fixed region proposal method that increases overall computation time and reduces accuracy comparing to Region Proposal Network (RPN) based object detectors such as Faster RCNN. The purpose of this paper is to design an efficient end-to-end incremental object detector using knowledge distillation. We first evaluate and analyze the performance of the RPN-based detector with classic distillation on incremental detection tasks. Then, we introduce multi-network adaptive distillation that properly retains knowledge from the old categories when fine-tuning the model for new task. Experiments on the benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and COCO, demonstrate that the proposed incremental detector based on Faster RCNN is more accurate as well as being 13 times faster than the baseline detector.},

Therefore, BP is considered as a natural candidate for broadband optical applications, particularly in the infrared (IR) and mid-IR part of the spectrum. The strong light-matter interaction, narrow direct band-gap, and wide range of tunable optical response make BP as a promising nonlinear optical material, particularly with great potentials for infrared and mid-infrared opto-electronics. Herein, we experimentally verified its broadband and enhanced saturable absorption of multi-layer BP (with a thickness of $\sim$10 nm) by wide-band Z-scan measurement technique, and anticipated that multi-layer BPs could be developed as another new type of two-dimensional saturable absorber with operation bandwidth ranging from the visible (400 nm) towards mid-IR (at least 1930 nm). Our results might suggest that ultra-thin multi-layer BP films could be potentially developed as broadband ultra-fast photonics devices, such as passive Q-switcher, mode-locker, optical switcher etc.},

abstract = {Fluorescence probes represent the most important area of fluorescence spectroscopy. The wavelength and time resolution required of the instruments is determined by the spectral properties of the fluorophores. Furthermore, the information available from the experiments is determined by the properties of the probes. Only probes with non-zero anisotropies can be used to measure rotational diffusion, and the lifetime of the fluorophore must be comparable to the timescale of interest in the experiment. Only probes that are sensitive to pH can be used to measure pH. And only probes with reasonably long excitation and emission wavelengths can be used in tissues, which display autofluorescence at short excitation wavelengths. Thousands of fluorescent probes are known, and it is not practical to describe them all. This chapter contains an overview of the various types of fluorophores, their spectral properties, and applications. Fluorophores can be broadly divided into two main classesâintrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic fluorophores are those that occur naturally. These include the aromatic amino acids, NADH, flavins, derivatives of pyridoxyl, and chlorophyll. Extrinsic fluorophores are added to the sample to provide fluorescence when none exists, or to change the spectral properties of the sample. Extrinsic fluorophores include dansyl, fluorescein, rho-damine, and numerous other substances.},

The need of increased time resolution of forecast in order to implement such methodologies is driving stakeholders to long for new more specialized forecast approaches that will take into account the special drivers of water demand in each case study. Advanced techniques have the ability to overcome the nonlinearity issues commonly met when investigating the complex relationship of water demand and weather, socioeconomic and other variables. In this article we present two approaches, an Artificial Neural Network and an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System, for forecasting a Mediterranean touristic resort daily water demand based on weather variables, tourism and leakage. Both models seem to have an adequate response, though ANFIS can more smoothly catch winter non-touristic water demand profile.},

abstract = {Self-supervised learning achieves superior performance in many domains by extracting useful representations from the unlabeled data. However, most of traditional self-supervised methods mainly focus on exploring the inter-sample structure while less efforts have been concentrated on the underlying intra-temporal structure, which is important for time series data. In this paper, we present SelfTime: a general self-supervised time series representation learning framework, by exploring the inter-sample relation and intra-temporal relation of time series to learn the underlying structure feature on the unlabeled time series. Specifically, we first generate the inter-sample relation by sampling positive and negative samples of a given anchor sample, and intra-temporal relation by sampling time pieces from this anchor. Then, based on the sampled relation, a shared feature extraction backbone combined with two separate relation reasoning heads are employed to quantify the relationships of the sample pairs for inter-sample relation reasoning, and the relationships of the time piece pairs for intra-temporal relation reasoning, respectively. Finally, the useful representations of time series are extracted from the backbone under the supervision of relation reasoning heads. Experimental results on multiple real-world time series datasets for time series classification task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

abstract = {Although CaO is one of the most studied basic heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of biodiesel, there are important issues that have been addressed by only a few research groups and that deserve further investigation. This is the case of the difficulties introduced by the poisoning of CaO upon exposure to ambient air and the role played by CaO-glycerol complexes on the catalytic performance. The purpose of this work is to provide new information on these issues in order to contribute to a better understanding of the underlying phenomena. Four commercial CaO samples have been considered to investigate their activation and stability under reaction conditions. In addition, calcium glyceroxide, and, for the first time, calcium glycerolate, have been synthesized and compared with the materials obtained from the commercial samples. The solids have been characterized with special emphasis on the assessment of their basic properties. The catalytic tests revealed big differences between the performance of the commercial solids that were substantially reduced after calcination and, specially, Ca-glyceroxide formation during reaction. Ca-glycerolate was the most resistant catalyst to ambient air although it was characterized by a low initial activity. Ca-glyceroxide could be reutilized for at least 5 reaction cycles without activity loss. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

abstract = {Approximately 8-20% of breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy fail to achieve a measurable response and endure toxic side effects without benefit. Most clinical and imaging measures of response are obtained several weeks after the start of therapy. Here, we report that functional hemodynamic and metabolic information acquired using a noninvasive optical imaging method on the first day after neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment can discriminate nonresponding from responding patients. Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging was used to measure absolute concentrations of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, water, and lipid in tumor and normal breast tissue of 24 tumors in 23 patients with untreated primary breast cancer. Measurements were made before chemotherapy, on day 1 after the first infusion, and frequently during the first week of therapy. Various multidrug, multicycle regimens were used to treat patients. Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging measurements were compared with final postsurgical pathologic response. A statistically significant increase, or flare, in oxyhemoglobin was observed in partial responding (n = 11) and pathologic complete responding tumors (n = 8) on day 1, whereas nonresponders (n = 5) showed no flare and a subsequent decrease in oxyhemoglobin on day 1. Oxyhemoglobin flare on day 1 was adequate to discriminate nonresponding tumors from responding tumors. Very early measures of chemotherapy response are clinically convenient and offer the potential to alter treatment strategies, resulting in improved patient outcomes.},

abstract = {Accurate forecasting of renewable energy sources plays a key role in their integration into the grid. This paper proposes a hybrid solar irradiance forecasting framework using a Transformation based K-means algorithm, named TB K-means, to increase the forecast accuracy. The proposed clustering method is a combination of a new initialization technique, K-means algorithm and a new gradual data transformation approach. Unlike the other K-means based clustering methods which are not capable of providing a fixed and definitive answer due to the selection of different cluster centroids for each run, the proposed clustering provides constant results for different runs of the algorithm. The proposed clustering is combined with a time-series analysis, a novel cluster selection algorithm and a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) to develop the hybrid solar radiation forecasting method for different time horizons (1 h ahead, 2 h ahead, ..., 48 h ahead). The performance of the proposed TB K-means clustering is evaluated using several different datasets and compared with different variants of K-means algorithm. Solar datasets with different solar radiation characteristics are also used to determine the accuracy and processing speed of the developed forecasting method with the proposed TB K-means and other clustering techniques. The results of direct comparison with other well-established forecasting models demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed hybrid forecasting method. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with the benchmark solar radiation forecasting models shows that the proposed model gives better forecasting results.},

Although data from (interventional) experiments is usually limited, large amounts of observational time series data sets are usually available.

We propose Neural Additive Vector Autoregression (NAVAR) models, a neural approach to causal structure learning that can discover nonlinear relationships. We train deep neural networks that extract the (additive) Granger causal influences from the time evolution in multi-variate time series.

abstract = {The problem of multi-label classification with missing labels (MLML) is a common challenge that is prevalent in several domains, e.g. image annotation and auto-tagging. In multi-label classification, each instance may belong to multiple class labels simultaneously. Due to the nature of the dataset collection and labelling procedure, it is common to have incomplete annotations in the dataset, i.e. not all samples are labelled with all the corresponding labels. However, the incomplete data labelling hinders the training of classification models. MLML has received much attention from the research community. However, in cases where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on an MLML dataset, there has been no straightforward approach to tackle the missing labels, specifically when there is no information about which are the missing ones. In this paper, we propose a weighted loss function to account for the confidence in each label/sample pair that can easily be incorporated to fine-tune a pre-trained model on an incomplete dataset. Our experiment results show that using the proposed loss function improves the performance of the model as the ratio of missing labels increases.},

The aim of lifelong learning is to develop a system that can learn new tasks while maintaining the performance on the previously learned tasks. However, there are two obstacles for lifelong learning of deep neural networks: catastrophic forgetting and capacity limitation. To solve the above issues, inspired by the recent breakthroughs in automatically learning good neural network architectures, we develop a Multi-task based lifelong learning via nonexpansive AutoML framework termed Regularize, Expand and Compress (REC). REC is composed of three stages: 1) continually learns the sequential tasks without the learned tasks' data via a newly proposed multi-task weight consolidation (MWC) algorithm; 2) expands the network to help the lifelong learning with potentially improved model capability and performance by network-transformation based AutoML; 3) compresses the expanded model after learning every new task to maintain model efficiency and performance. The proposed MWC and REC algorithms achieve superior performance over other lifelong learning algorithms on four different datasets.},

abstract = {In a typical multi-label setting, a picture contains on average few positive labels, and many negative ones. This positive-negative imbalance dominates the optimization process, and can lead to under-emphasizing gradients from positive labels during training, resulting in poor accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel asymmetric loss ("ASL"), which operates differently on positive and negative samples. The loss enables to dynamically down-weights and hard-thresholds easy negative samples, while also discarding possibly mislabeled samples. We demonstrate how ASL can balance the probabilities of different samples, and how this balancing is translated to better mAP scores. With ASL, we reach state-of-the-art results on multiple popular multi-label datasets: MS-COCO, Pascal-VOC, NUS-WIDE and Open Images. We also demonstrate ASL applicability for other tasks, such as single-label classification and object detection. ASL is effective, easy to implement, and does not increase the training time or complexity. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ASL.},

@article{Allen-Zhu2019a,
abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated dominating performance in many fields; since AlexNet, networks used in practice are going wider and deeper. On the theoretical side, a long line of works have been focusing on why we can train neural networks when there is only one hidden layer. The theory of multi-layer networks remains unsettled. In this work, we prove simple algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can find global minima on the training objective of DNNs in polynomial time. We only make two assumptions: the inputs do not degenerate and the network is over-parameterized. The latter means the number of hidden neurons is sufficiently large: polynomial in L, the number of DNN layers and in n, the number of training samples. As concrete examples, starting from randomly initialized weights, we show that SGD attains 100% training accuracy in classification tasks, or minimizes regression loss in linear convergence speed $\epsilon$ e-$\Omega$(T) with running time polynomial in n and L. Our theory applies to the widely-used but non-smooth ReLU activation, and to any smooth and possibly non-convex loss functions. In terms of network architectures, our theory at least applies to fully-connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and residual neural networks (ResNet).},

One sees it as the inevitable outcome of a largely exogenous increase in the supply of new ideas and ways of thinking. The other sees it as a demand side response to economic incentives-that in Britain, it paid to invent the technology of the Industrial Revolution. However, this second interpretation relies on the assumption that inventors were sufficiently responsive to new commercial opportunities. This paper tests this assumption, using a new dataset of Scottish and Irish patents. It finds that the propensity of inventors to extend patent protection into Scotland and/or Ireland was indeed closely correlated with the relative market opportunity of the patented invention.},

Various industries including the automotive industry are full of potential MRF applications. Magneto-rheological fluid technology has been successfully employed already in various low and high volume applications. A structure based on MRF might be the next generation in design for products where power density, accuracy and dynamic performance are the key features. Additionally, for products where is a need to control fluid motion by varying the viscosity, a structure based on MRF might be an improvement in functionality and costs. Two aspects of this technology, direct shear mode (used in brakes and clutches) and valve mode (used in dampers) have been studied thoroughly and several applications are already present on the market. Excellent features like fast response, simple interface between electrical power input and mechanical power output, and precise controllability make MRF technology attractive for many applications. This paper presents the state of the art of an actuator with a control arrangement based on MRF technology. The study shows that excellent features like fast response, simple interface between electrical power input and the mechanical power output, and controllability make MRF the next technology of choice for many applications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Object detection with transformers (DETR) reaches competitive performance with Faster R-CNN via a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Inspired by the great success of pre-training transformers in natural language processing, we propose a pretext task named random query patch detection to unsupervisedly pre-train DETR (UP-DETR) for object detection. Specifically, we randomly crop patches from the given image and then feed them as queries to the decoder. The model is pre-trained to detect these query patches from the original image. During the pre-training, we address two critical issues: multi-task learning and multi-query localization. (1) To trade-off multi-task learning of classification and localization in the pretext task, we freeze the CNN backbone and propose a patch feature reconstruction branch which is jointly optimized with patch detection. (2) To perform multi-query localization, we introduce UP-DETR from single-query patch and extend it to multi-query patches with object query shuffle and attention mask. In our experiments, UP-DETR significantly boosts the performance of DETR with faster convergence and higher precision on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. The code will be available soon.},

abstract = {In this manuscript, a vehicle allocation problem involving a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles for delivering products from a manufacturing firm to a set of depots is considered. Each depot has a specific order quantity and transportation costs consist of fixed and variable transportation cost. The objective is to assign the proper type and number of vehicle to each depot route to minimize the total transportation costs. It is assumed that the number of chartering vehicle types is limited. It is also assumed that a discount mechanism is applied to the vehicles renting cost. The discount mechanism is applied to the fixed cost, based on the number of vehicles to be rented. A mathematical programming model is proposed which is then converted to a mixed 0-1 integer programming model. Due to the computational complexity of the proposed mathematical model, a priority based genetic algorithm capable of solving the real world size problems was proposed. A computational experiment is conducted through which, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm is capable of providing the astonishing solutions with minimal computational effort, comparing with the CPLEX solutions.},

In Study 1, we find that participants give more biased answers in a memory test in warmer, compared to colder, environments. In Studies 2â3b, physical warmth fosters a response bias toward the affirmation of unrelated items in questionnaires. In Study 4, the effect of physical warmth on the affirmation bias is amplified when the person reading a participant's answers is a friend (stronger affiliation prime) compared to a stranger. Taken together, temperature affects general response behavior by fostering affirmation. Thereby, physical temperature has deeper psychological as well as methodological consequences than previously thought.},

The main purpose is to minimize the weight of an assembly system composed of a shaft and two ball bearings. Ball bearings link system is used extensively in many machinery applications. Among mechanical systems, designers pay great attention to the ball bearings link system because of its significant industrial importance. The problem is complex and a time consuming process due to mixed design variables and inequality constraints imposed on the objective function. The results showed that the DE and the SA performed and obtained convergence reliability on the global optimum solution. So the contribution of the DE and the SA application to the mechanical system design can be very useful in many real-world mechanical system design problems. Beside, the comparison confirms the effectiveness and the superiority of the DE over the others algorithms â the SA, the GA, and the ES â in terms of solution quality.

abstract = {Reinforcement learning systems require good representations to work well. For decades practical success in reinforcement learning was limited to small domains. Deep reinforcement learning systems, on the other hand, are scalable, not dependent on domain specific prior knowledge and have been successfully used to play Atari, in 3D navigation from pixels, and to control high degree of freedom robots. Unfortunately, the performance of deep reinforcement learning systems is sensitive to hyper-parameter settings and architecture choices. Even well tuned systems exhibit significant instability both within a trial and across experiment replications. In practice, significant expertise and trial and error are usually required to achieve good performance. One potential source of the problem is known as catastrophic interference: when later training decreases performance by overriding previous learning. Interestingly, the powerful generalization that makes Neural Networks (NN) so effective in batch supervised learning might explain the challenges when applying them in reinforcement learning tasks. In this paper, we explore how online NN training and interference interact in reinforcement learning. We find that simply re-mapping the input observations to a high-dimensional space improves learning speed and parameter sensitivity. We also show this preprocessing reduces interference in prediction tasks. More practically, we provide a simple approach to NN training that is easy to implement, and requires little additional computation. We demonstrate that our approach improves performance in both prediction and control with an extensive batch of experiments in classic control domains.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a new framework for time-series modeling that combines the best of traditional statistical models and neural networks. We focus on time-series with long-range dependencies, needed for monitoring fine granularity data (e.g. minutes, seconds, milliseconds), prevalent in operational use-cases. Traditional models, such as auto-regression fitted with least squares (Classic-AR) can model time-series with a concise and interpretable model. When dealing with long-range dependencies, Classic-AR models can become intractably slow to fit for large data. Recently, sequence-to-sequence models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks, which were originally intended for natural language processing, have become popular for time-series. However, they can be overly complex for typical time-series data and lack interpretability. A scalable and interpretable model is needed to bridge the statistical and deep learning-based approaches. As a first step towards this goal, we propose modelling AR-process dynamics using a feed-forward neural network approach, termed AR-Net. We show that AR-Net is as interpretable as Classic-AR but also scales to long-range dependencies. Our results lead to three major conclusions: First, AR-Net learns identical AR-coefficients as Classic-AR, thus being equally interpretable. Second, the computational complexity with respect to the order of the AR process, is linear for AR-Net as compared to a quadratic for Classic-AR. This makes it possible to model long-range dependencies within fine granularity data. Third, by introducing regularization, AR-Net automatically selects and learns sparse AR-coefficients. This eliminates the need to know the exact order of the AR-process and allows to learn sparse weights for a model with long-range dependencies.},

The research effort in large-scale energy harvesting has mainly focused on piezoelectric ceramic based devices, due to its high piezoelectric constants. In this study, we demonstrate a piezoelectric energy harvester module based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer for roadway applications. Flexible energy harvesters are fabricated with PVDF films and it exhibited stable performance and durability over the repeated number of bending cycles. In order to structurally optimize the design, finite element analysis was performed on two possible module configuration, with detailed input conditions on how the flexible energy harvester must be bent. A piezoelectric energy harvester module is then constructed with the fabricated unit energy harvesters inserted in the vertical direction, with initial radii of curvature as high as possible. The module was tested with a model mobile load system (MMLS3) and exhibited up to 200Â mW instantaneous power output across a 40Â k$\Omega$ resistor. The power output scaled linearly with the number of parallel connected harvesters. The calculated power density at this impedance reaches up to 8.9Â W/m2, suggesting that the flexible energy harvesters based on the piezoelectric polymers may provide energy density as high as those based on piezoelectric ceramics.},

abstract = {Current advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have achieved unprecedented impact across research communities and industry. Nevertheless, concerns about trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI were raised by influential thinkers. Many have identified the need for well-founded knowledge representation and reasoning to be integrated with deep learning and for sound explainability. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active area of research for many years seeking to bring together robust learning in neural networks with reasoning and explainability via symbolic representations for network models. In this paper, we relate recent and early research results in neurosymbolic AI with the objective of identifying the key ingredients of the next wave of AI systems. We focus on research that integrates in a principled way neural network-based learning with symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning. The insights provided by 20 years of neural-symbolic computing are shown to shed new light onto the increasingly prominent role of trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI. We also identify promising directions and challenges for the next decade of AI research from the perspective of neural-symbolic systems.},

abstract = {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.

This catastrophic forgetting phenomenon impacts on the deployment of artificial intelligence in real world scenarios where systems need to learn new and different representations over time. Current approaches for incremental learning deal only with image classification and object detection tasks, while in this work we formally introduce incremental learning for semantic segmentation. We tackle the problem applying various knowledge distillation techniques on the previous model. In this way, we retain the information about learned classes, whilst updating the current model to learn the new ones. We developed four main methodologies of knowledge distillation working on both output layers and internal feature representations. We do not store any image belonging to previous training stages and only the last model is used to preserve high accuracy on previously learned classes. Extensive experimental results on the Pascal VOC2012 and MSRC-v2 datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in several incremental learning scenarios.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

After learning the object classes incrementally, the robot performs a table cleaning task organizing objects into categories specified by the human. We also demonstrate the system's ability to learn arrangements of objects and predict missing or incorrectly placed objects.

abstract = {Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) capture long dependencies and context, and hence are the key component of typical sequential data based tasks. However, the sequential nature of RNNs dictates a large inference cost for long sequences even if the hardware supports parallelization. To induce long-term dependencies, and yet admit parallelization, we introduce novel shallow RNNs. In this architecture, the first layer splits the input sequence and runs several independent RNNs. The second layer consumes the output of the first layer using a second RNN thus capturing long dependencies. We provide theoretical justification for our architecture under weak assumptions that we verify on real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that for time-series classification, our technique leads to substantially improved inference time over standard RNNs without compromising accuracy. For example, we can deploy audio-keyword classification on tiny Cortex M4 devices (100MHz processor, 256KB RAM, no DSP available) which was not possible using standard RNN models. Similarly, using ShaRNN in the popular Listen-Attend-Spell (LAS) architecture for phoneme classification [4], we can reduce the lag in phoneme classification by 10-12x while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.},

abstract = {Calcium carbonate scaling and silica scaling are critical challenges directly affecting the efficiency of production during operational periods for geothermal power plants or geothermal district heating systems. Although their precipitation mechanisms are different from each other, both can be observed in varied proportions in production and reinjection wells as well as surface equipment in geothermal systems. Thus, scale prevention and control systems are essential, as abatement of scaling is more efficient than removal from wells and equipment after precipitation in a geothermal system. There are a few methods for control of silica and calcium carbonate precipitation in geothermal wells and surface equipment. Most production and reinjection wells require the implementation of a silica/calcium carbonate inhibition system to prevent silica/calcite precipitation inside casings, pipes, separators and other surface equipment in geothermal power systems. Installation of inhibitor systems are the most effective and practical solution for prevention of scaling problems and production loss, if the optimum inhibitor dosages are determined and applied effectively in geothermal systems. Less than optimum ratios of inhibitors may result in product overfeed, increased costs, and in some cases, inhibitor-induced fouling. The system is nonlinear and has multiple dependent and independent variables thus, it is difficult to obtain a mathematical model that describes the relation of geothermal fluid characteristic and inhibitors and with this reason, a fuzzy controller may be good option to resolve it in geothermal systems. Fuzzy control may replace the role of the mathematical model in conservative controllers, substituting it with a different model that is built from a number of smaller rules that only describe a sub-section of the complete system. In this study, two fuzzy logic controllers have been designed to control precipitation of silica and calcium carbonate by using scale inhibitors.},

abstract = {Unsupervised contrastive learning achieves great success in learning image representations with CNN. Unlike most recent methods that focused on improving accuracy of image classification, we present a novel contrastive learning approach, named DetCo, which fully explores the contrasts between global image and local image patches to learn discriminative representations for object detection. DetCo has several appealing benefits. (1) It is carefully designed by investigating the weaknesses of current self-supervised methods, which discard important representations for object detection. (2) DetCo builds hierarchical intermediate contrastive losses between global image and local patches to improve object detection, while maintaining global representations for image recognition. Theoretical analysis shows that the local patches actually remove the contextual information of an image, improving the lower bound of mutual information for better contrastive learning. (3) Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, COCO and Cityscapes demonstrate that DetCo not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on object detection, but also on segmentation, pose estimation, and 3D shape prediction, while it is still competitive on image classification. For example, on PASCAL VOC, DetCo-100ep achieves 57.4 mAP, which is on par with the result of MoCov2-800ep. Moreover, DetCo consistently outperforms supervised method by 1.6/1.2/1.0 AP on Mask RCNN-C4/FPN/RetinaNet with 1x schedule.

These data sets, such as hourly medical records in intensive care units and multi-frequency phonetic time series, often time exhibit not only strong serial dependencies in the individual components (the "marginal" memory) but also non-negligible memories in the cross-sectional dependencies (the "joint" memory). Because of the multivariate complexity in the evolution of the joint distribution that underlies the data generating process, we take a data-driven approach and construct a novel recurrent network architecture, termed Memory-Gated Recurrent Networks (mGRN), with gates explicitly regulating two distinct types of memories: the marginal memory and the joint memory. Through a combination of comprehensive simulation studies and empirical experiments on a range of public datasets, we show that our proposed mGRN architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art architectures targeting multivariate time series.},
