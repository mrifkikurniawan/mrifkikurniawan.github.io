I am an artificial intelligence engineer at [Nodeflux](http://nodeflux.io/ "Nodeflux"), first and biggest vision AI company in Indonesia, with practical hands-on experience performing deep learning-based computer vision for recognition and surveillance. Right now, I am working on developing object recognition for real-time vehicle surveillance by employing deep learning for detection. Recently, I am also working on retail products/FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) detector and recognition model with input image of shelf scene.

Moreover, I am a master student at Computer Science and Technology, [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). Gratefully, I am joining [Machine Intelligence and Vision Group (MIV-XJTU)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TNflPIMQyqlQXU2C8pPN-w) lead by [Prof. Yihong Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x2xdU7gAAAAJ&hl=en) for solving fundamental issues on machine learning and computer vision especially studying and exploring continual learning and representation learning under supervision of [Dr. Xing Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KNyC5EUAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I have finished my bachelor in engineering physics at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya](https://www.its.ac.id/ "Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya") with bachelor thesis on "Design of Mobile Predictor for Maritime Weather Forecasting Using Hybrid Method of Type 2 Fuzzy Logic and Artificial Neural Network with Differential Evolution Algorithm Optimization" under supervision of [Dr. Ir. Syamsul Arifin M.T](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q0UuffwAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1 "Dr. Ir. Syamsul Arifin M.T") and [Prof. Dr. Ir. Aulia Siti Aisjah M.T.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o7hyMS4AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1 "Prof. Dr. Ir. Aulia Siti Aisjah M.T.").
