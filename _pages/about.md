I am a master student at Computer Science and Technology, [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am fortunate to be part of [Machine Intelligence and Vision Group (MIV-XJTU)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TNflPIMQyqlQXU2C8pPN-w), led by the renowned [Prof. Yihong Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x2xdU7gAAAAJ&hl=en). Under the guidance of [Prof. Yang Qi](http://ctec.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1011/1080.htm) and [Dr. Xing Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KNyC5EUAAAAJ&hl=en), I am actively engaged in super exciting research on enhancing the capability of neural networks to learning continuously without forgetting. I am also loving deep dive into representation learning, transfer learning, low-shot learning, and multi-task learning. Beside my study, I am also work as an AI engineer at [Nodeflux](http://nodeflux.io/ "Nodeflux"), a leading vision AI company based in Indonesia. My responsibilities entail working on cool projects involving end-to-end deep learning-based analytics. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor's degree in engineering physics at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya](https://www.its.ac.id/ "Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya") where I strated on my neural network journey under the mentorship of [Dr. Syamsul Arifin](https://scholar.its.ac.id/en/persons/syamsul-arifin "Dr. Syamsul Arifin") and [Prof. Aulia Siti Aisjah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o7hyMS4AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1 "Prof. Aulia Siti Aisjah"). I enjoy diving into the world of non-fiction books, spanning various subjects, including science, neuroscience, history, and many others.

If you have an awesome project you'd like to collaborate on or simply want to chat about anything related to AI, technology, or even recommend a great non-fiction read, feel free to connect with me!
