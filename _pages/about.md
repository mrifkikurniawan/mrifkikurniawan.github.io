I'm Senior Data Scientist at [GoTo Group](https://www.gotocompany.com/en), working on eKYC with computer vision, and PhD student at [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) with supervision of [Prof. Christopher Kanan](http://chriskanan.com/). I am interested in learning deep neural networks in continual settings without catastrophic forgetting and how shape bias improve generalization on neural networks.

I got my master's in Computer Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), where I worked with the awesome [Machine Intelligence and Vision Group (MIV-XJTU)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TNflPIMQyqlQXU2C8pPN-w). Under [Prof. Yang Qi](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/yangqi) and [Prof. Xing Wei](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/weixing), I researched ways to help neural networks learn new things without forgetting old ones. Before that, I worked as an ML Engineer at [Fintelite](https://fintelite.ai/) doing AI for finance, and at [Nodeflux](http://nodeflux.io/ "Nodeflux") building end-to-end deep learning for vision systems. I started my journey in tech with a bachelor's in engineering physics from [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya](https://www.its.ac.id/ "Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya"), where [Dr. Syamsul Arifin](https://scholar.its.ac.id/en/persons/syamsul-arifin "Dr. Syamsul Arifin") and [Prof. Aulia Siti Aisjah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o7hyMS4AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1 "Prof. Aulia Siti Aisjah") first got me excited about neural networks.

I enjoy diving into the world of non-fiction books, spanning various subjects, including science, neuroscience and history.
