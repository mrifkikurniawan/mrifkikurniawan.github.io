I'm machine learning engineer at [Fintelite](https://fintelite.ai/), working on AI for finance, and graduate student at Xi'an Jiatong University, working on continual learning and vision-language model. Recently, I completed my master degree in Computer Science and Technology at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). During this period, I had the privilege of being part of the [Machine Intelligence and Vision Group (MIV-XJTU)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TNflPIMQyqlQXU2C8pPN-w), under the guidance of [Prof. Yang Qi](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/yangqi) and [Prof. Xing Wei](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/weixing). Where, I am actively engaged in research on enhancing the capability of neural networks to *learning continuously without forgetting*. 

Previously, I was also an AI engineer at [Nodeflux](http://nodeflux.io/ "Nodeflux") working on end-to-end deep learning-based for vision analytics. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor degree in engineering physics at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya](https://www.its.ac.id/ "Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya") where I strated on my neural network journey under the mentorship of [Dr. Syamsul Arifin](https://scholar.its.ac.id/en/persons/syamsul-arifin "Dr. Syamsul Arifin") and [Prof. Aulia Siti Aisjah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o7hyMS4AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1 "Prof. Aulia Siti Aisjah"). I enjoy diving into the world of non-fiction books, spanning various subjects, including science, neuroscience and history.
