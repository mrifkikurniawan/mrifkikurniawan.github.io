In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.   The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.   The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data.   This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require basic Python and numpy knowledge. At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.

        "title": "From Cuneiform to Binary, from Stone to Cloud Memory",
        "excerpt":"[Medium]      Just imagine we lived in the 7000 years ago when no letters of alphabet A, B, C to Z were found, or we could not count the number of our fish caught because there were no known names such as numbers 1,2,3 or 9. Then how do we convey event A or information B and then, furthermore, store it so that it becomes our track record in the future?    In the beginning, humans only relied on the most important organ of themselves as storage memory, the brain. Though the brain has 3 fundamental flaws according to Yuval Noah Harari. First, the brain has limited capacities. Up to now, researchers are still unable to determine how much memory capacity our brains have. According to Paul Reber, professor of psychology at Northwestern University, which was reported by Scientific American, the human brain consists of about one billion neurons, each of which is connected with 1000 other neurons; thus, forming about 3 trillion connections. If quantified in data size, it can be estimated that around 2.5 petabits (million gigabits), which means that capacity can be used to record millions of hours of video. However, it was all just an estimate; the researchers still could not determine the actual size because we do not know how to measure actual memory. Meanwhile, certain experiences require more detail so that they require more space in the brain so that other experiences are forgotten and free up to certain spaces in the brain.   Secondly, the information stored in the brain will be destroyed when someone who owns the brain dies. If Einstein lived 7000 years ago and assumed that he had found the postulate of the workings of the universe through the theory of general and special relativity. It is almost certain that the theory will not be known by humans of modern civilization. It might be possible to find it, but it will take several hundred years to uncover it with a large investment of research. We must find traces of historical information and data without writing, drawing, painting because writing as a manifestation of ideas that were not discovered yet at that time. Einstein’s ideas will die when Einstein also dies.   And third, the human brain is adapted to store and process certain types of information. By learning, fruit traders can differentiate between rotten and fresh fruits by just seeing or feeling a few parts. Or a snake charmer who becomes a master handler by studying snake behavior, when he can be subdued and not.   The Emergence of Clay and Stone Letters and Storage Technology  The writings were first discovered by the Sumerian people who lived in the southern region of Mesopotamia around 3400–3000 BC. By scientists, Sumer is considered the first urban civilization in the world, Ancient Mesopotamia as a place where civilization emerged. This article was later called cuneiform. The geniuses there for the first time used this letter to count and record. In his book “Sapiens”, Yuval Noah Harari explained that Sumerian’s first manuscripts only contained documents about the economy, tax payment records, debt accumulation, and property ownership.                 Cuneiform, the oldest letter system in the world. Source: https://www.historyextra.com/.    The Sumerian writing system stores information with two marks printed on clay plates. However, with this breakthrough, the Sumerians were able to store far more data than any human brain. Nobody expected this article to make an important momentum of change in the civilization of all time. Until then developed and produced writing that was created in the Mesopotamian era like The Epic of Gilgamesh, Atrahasis, The Descent of Inanna, The Myth of Etana, and The Enuma Elishiyang written in cuneiform. It takes several centuries of research to be understood by modern humans.   Until the middle of the 19th century, George Smith (1840–1876) and Henry Rawlinson (1810–1895) translated The Epic of Gilgamesh into English. Which then becomes momentum the opening of Mesopotamian historical data. This is the beginning of the writing which is then followed by variations of writing and language that we know today. Writing makes a man able to manifest information in his brain so that it becomes a solution to the deficiency of the brain and reduces brain function as a place to store information.   In the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms civilization in Indonesia, royal information such as the names of kings or stories of royal struggles is written. Imagine if this story is stored in the memories of the governors, maybe the story will not last long. And it might not be enjoyed by children and grandchildren for hundreds of years to come. However, the writing was manifested in stone which we call inscriptions and papers which when compiled into books make the age of information last longer, beyond human life.   If the internet has been discovered, maybe a royal IT expert will create a royal website and write down all the information in it. Academics owned by the kingdom will write a biography of one of the kings and write historical events and the royal officials will always record the income and expenditure of the king’s finances through word excel from his computer. All information will be recorded and read by future generations. After that, all documents will be uploaded to cloud-based storage to secure the data.   However, the human brain has not developed that far. The best technology for long-lasting data storage is still in the form of stones, tree trunks, and when it’s better to find books. In the 14th century, in the kingdom of Majapahit, we can find traces left in the form of books like Kakawin Nagarakrtagama by Empu Prapanca. The book makes it easy for the current generation to learn about life in Majapahit and uncover important events. This proves the availability of recorded information is very helpful in the world of research in revealing how people used to be active and working, the political and economic system, or the government system.   When Binary Letters Meet Silicon and Transistors  At present, we are in the era of transistors, silicon, and binary numbers. Information and data can not only be recorded in writing but also images and videos. Someone who today records himself eating at a traditional flavored Javanese restaurant using his Apple smartphone and uploading it to an Instagram account will forever be a track record that can be opened 100 or 500 years later.   As one Middle Eastern expert did, who can determine where hoax news is based on images in articles that are compared to the same images in certain articles using Google Image and tracks the biodata of a terrorist child and his affiliates from his photo and social media accounts using the same method for tracking the originality of an article.   The development of human civilization can not be separated from the human ability to simplify all forms of information into two numbers, 1 and 0. Two numbers that are enough to make information last forever. With the help of the formation of an internet network that can be regarded as a worldwide network of information people become goods that are no longer valuable because the amount is very abundant. Internet networks are revolutionizing the way information spreads, the presentation of information, and the age of information. With just a few fingers touch on the smartphone layer, one can make threats to a country.   The internet, which basically uses binary numbers in its information transmission, with pulses of the speed of light transmitted through optical fibers as it is now, makes information more quickly conveyed by the construction of complex networks. This makes information can be archived to other computers.   Today we know of Cloud technology, for example, owned by large companies such as Google, Amazon, or Alibaba. If they’re used to be a library that had to be destroyed to conquer and win the war. In the future cloud server might be the main target in winning the war.   Today we cannot only store information in written form. Even pictures and moving images (video) is the best way to store information. In the past, humans used language and writing to describe the atmosphere of events around them. There can be misinterpretations there, but since humans are able to record. Information storage of an event can be directly seen without the help of human reasoning.   So what happens is eternity and ease in getting data and storing it. One day, 1,000 or 10,000 years to come to the next generation will not be difficult to explore and recognize human behavior now. All are available, all easily accessible. The abundance of information will shift the problem for the next generation from the initial allocation of energy to search to the need for more energy to assess and classify.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Industry 4.0-The Communicating Machines",
        "excerpt":"[Medium]   It All Started From a Sewing Machine  In 1589, Queen Elizabeth I refused to grant a patent on someone’s intelligent invention, he was William Lee, who was able to model hand movements when knitting on a machine. The Queen refused on the grounds that this machine would damage the conventional textile industry. After that, 200 years later this tool revolutionized the way the textile industry worked, the machine that had been rejected by the queen to be the most used machine in all textile industries at that time. By using massively this technology, the textile industry is able to mass-produce fabric in a faster time. This then became the most important momentum in initiating the first industrial revolution.   Late in the 18th century, to be exact, the first industrial revolution took place. This event has inherited steam technology and engine-based power that can replace the strength of human muscle. This first industrial revolution was based on Newton’s discovery when formulating the law of motion. Since then, the motion can be better understood and measured, which then allows humans to make steam engines that can mechanize the work previously done by humans (Xing and Marwala, 2017). This first industrial revolution can be said to be the birth of a machine.   Great Britain became the first region to face this revolutionary change which later spread to Europe and America. This change has penetrated every aspect of life, not apart from the jobs and occupations which then changed the entire social order and psychology of society.   The lower-middle-class workers who rely more on the ability of muscles replaced by the machines. The first industrial revolution resulted in at least 1/3 of the total workers were laid off no work and another 1/3 working part-time because of the ability to work have been taken over by machines. The utilization of the steam machines increases the need for coal which then raises the problem most often discussed today, global warming.                 The rate of birth and death of the population during and after the industrial revolution (Easton, 2013).    From the demographic aspect, in 1750 the number of British people 6.5 million people increased by 400% in 1990 to 32.5 million people. In 1750, 80% of rural people lived in villages and 20% of people lived in cities, turned 180 degrees in 1850, 80% of people lived in cities and 20% of people lived in villages.   The habit of the people who initially farmed and relied on food and food supplies from agricultural products turned into an industrial labor society working in factories and offices. Up to now, we can see the impact of the industrial revolution from the phenomenon of urbanization and dominated employment patterns in the industrial sector.   The Material Revolution and the Mobilization Revolution  100 years later, Sir Henry Bessemer discovered a new method of making steel from molten scrap metal. This method revolutionized steel manufacturing to be cheaper, increase the scale and speed of production, and reduce the need for workers in their manufacture (Mokyr, 1998).   As a result, the mass production of steel took place. Steel replaces iron which is proven to be weaker and more expensive. Steel which is proven to be cheaper and more durable enables the construction of railroad lines to be cheap, as a result, the acceleration of its construction can no longer be avoided. The existence of railroads and development that is increasingly equitable changes the pattern and intensity of transportation and supply chains which results in a decrease in commodity prices such as coal and steel.   This transportation system also revolutionized the mobilization of all things, including in the dissemination of information and knowledge. This discovery allows more humans to migrate for certain purposes such as learning. This then also changes how science and technology spread. Because the cheaper the means of transportation, the more easily accessible transportation, the more people and goods move at an affordable price. As a result, economic growth has increased and competency and expertise have also increased.   Faraday and Maxwell accelerated this two-volume industrial revolution through their magnetic and electrical forces which created the generation of electricity and electromagnetism that are widely used in industrial systems in the future (Xing and Marwala, 2017). This electricity supports the industry for mass production (Schwab, 2016).   Electrification is also the cause of the creation of major changes in industrial production methods, which are called the assembly line and mass production. Elective also gives the industry the ability to be able to work for 24 hours without stopping. This means that work time is also increasing for employees. They can work up to 10–16 hours a day. This brings workers to bad conditions such as low wages, poor working conditions (poor lighting, and no machine safety). This results in widespread poverty and very high depression.   Communication Revolution  Rapid mobilization has accelerated the spread of science and technology. The next era is the era of transistors. The transistor initiated the invention of computers and the internet. Transistors have led humans to the invention of computers that have become the fastest data processing machines ever. In the same era, the internet was discovered, the most massive distributor of information could be realized. The internet is changing the way humans spread information and knowledge.      Energy has become the basis of the second industrial revolution, while the third industrial revolution is the era of information and knowledge    Letters used to be very useful in sending news or spreading information. It takes days and even months to wait for a letter to be delivered to a specific destination. At that time the inter-mail system was still a unity with the transportation system, so the letter was very dependent on the development of the transportation system. Likewise knowledge, someone needs to go overseas and travel hundreds of kilometers to meet a teacher and get knowledge from him. After that, just back to the area to disseminate the knowledge gained. However, since the discovery of the internet, everything has changed. It only takes a few minutes for information to be conveyed. Content and science books available on computer servers on the internet can be downloaded and studied with just one or two clicks. The internet makes the earth turn faster.   Acceleration of knowledge has implications for the acceleration of innovation. This era makes the machine capable of sensing and making decisions individually. Computer technology takes the machine to the next generation, namely machine automation. Computers carrying machines in the industry can work without human control in accordance with what has been programmed by humans. At that time, data and information transfers were only limited to one factory system.   Intersystem data transfer is still not possible due to limitations in data transmission technology. Next is the era in which these systems communicate with each other and each individual system is able to learn and develop like humans. What was this era like?   Industrial Revolution 4.0  Today, we are at the end of industry 3.0 and are on a journey of transition to a change in industry style that we could not have foreseen, the cyber-physical industry 4.0. The third industrial revolution has been able to make the glass doors of offices open automatically or to be able to close the reservoir water in our homes when fully charged. Then what time will we face after this?   Imagine if we are leaving for work, then you call the car you have through a smartphone to take you and stop right in front of you. On the trip, you enjoy a cup of coffee that has been provided by the coffee maker every morning in your car and access the latest information through the screen projected on the windshield of your car. Meanwhile, your car is moving at a steady speed with self-driving capability without stopping due to traffic lights.   Yes, each car is able to communicate with each other so that it allows them to go without colliding. Such is the picture of industry 4.0 when all things have been made automatically, the next step is to make them able to communicate with each other like humans reprimand their friends when they meet or stay away from those who have problems with their health.   In 2011 at an event titled “Hannover Mesese” the German government launched a completely new concept of the future of the industry. Digitalization of manufacturing was adopted as the theme which became the basis of this future industrial concept, they named it “Industrie 4.0”. The academics and business leaders who poured the concept did not know that the concept would spread quickly and become a future industrial concept of the world. 5 years later, the concept became viral and was widely discussed at conferences and seminars related to the concept of the future industry.   Industry 4.0 is a new paradigm in the revolutionary way of industry. This paradigm creates the realization of integration and interconnection between machines, products, components, individuals, and information technology that are united in industrial systems. Integration, interconnection, and flexibility are the principles that this series of four industrial revolutions will bring. The fourth industrial revolution can be said to be machines that can communicate with each other.   This interaction allows traffic lights located in East Surabaya to communicate with traffic lights in West Surabaya to resolve traffic jams during work hours. Industry 4.0 can be said to be the next digitization of the manufacturing sector, which is controlled by 4 things: data empowerment, computing power, and connections; analytical and business intelligence capabilities; new ways of human interaction with machines such as touch layers and Augmented Reality; and increased transfer of data instructions to the physical world such as robotics and 3D printers (Lee et al., 2013).                 Industry Principles 4.0 (Cohen et al., 2017).    In industry 4.0, data will be the most valuable. Data in the form of numbers and letters that can be interpreted into information. This interpretation will be very useful in making decisions resulting from the processing of AI or Machine Learning. E-Commerce currently for example has used data to predict demand and determine the price of goods in accordance with the number of requests and purchases that are continuously monitored from the virtual activities of its customers. This is evidence of the realization of flexibility in industry 4.0 and business principles that are customer-oriented by understanding the behavior and activities of customers.   In the industrial era 4.0, technology development will refer to the fields of genetics, biotechnology, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and 3D printing (World Economic Forum, 2016). These technologies enable humans to work more efficiently and cheaper than they ever have. Artificial intelligence, for example, allows a computer to make decisions like an expert or expert system.   If humans can realize this, then authenticity will quickly be distributed to all computers and machines. The ability of experts to predict the surge in demand for goods or the value of the most appropriate goods is easily applied and disseminated. We only need a hardware device that has sensors and is connected to the internet (IoT). Then the AI software that is installed on hardware downloaded through the internet will manage that data to be the most effective and efficient expert decision ever made.                 Application of industrial sectors 4.0. (World Economic Forum and International BVL, 2017).    From Centralization Towards Decentralization  These years maybe the company’s production operations are still centralized. In this case, they need a fast distribution system to send their products. However, the next few years 3D printing will change it. 3D printing allows an automotive factory to produce goods in places that are affordable to customers. This will be able to minimize the distribution budget from the previous era.   Prediction using AI will enable companies to determine the best production points, complete with the number of items needed by the customer at that time. Here, 3D printers that have been placed at certain points will work according to requests sent from AI processed data. Each printer works according to the design that the company has sent to its software through a fiber optic communication network that connects the points of the production plant.   Changes in the pattern of production that are centralized in one point of production into a number of points of production which is a forecast of future production patterns. Each machine installed with AI software or machine learning will be able to make decisions individually based on centralized collective data (integration).   So that intelligent machines this time will be able to replace not only menial work but also the ability of logic and human thinking. The World Economic Forum with BVL International predicts the impact of the fourth industrial revolution on certain sectors such as employment, manufacturing and industry, supply chain, services and business models, and the company’s relationship with customers. Industry 4.0 will change the most essential things that humans have (Schwab, 2016).      Then what about humans? Are they ready to beat the expertise of machines and robots or even get rid of the robots they make?    Reference  Cohen, Y. et al.

        "excerpt":"Informasi cuaca maritim baik saat ini dan yang akan datang (prediksi) sangat berguna sebagai sistem pendukung dalam berbagai aktivitas maritim. Informasi tersebut sangat penting bagi nelayan untuk menentukan kelayakan jalur pelayaran. Bagi industri, informasi tersebut dapat digunakan sebagai pertimbangan aktivitas maritim seperti pada pembangkit energi terbarukan. Dalam konteks prediksi, beberapa prediktor masih menggunakan pendekatan statistik, di mana pendekatan ini memiliki akurasi rendah dan tidak dapat bekerja pada data nonliner. Penelitian ini merancang prediksi cuaca maritim menggunakan pendekatan artificial intelligence berupa sistem prediktor hybrid. Prediktor ini menggunakan prinsip persilangan antara dua metodologi, yaitu Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) dan Jaringan Saraf Tiruan-Propagasi Balik (JST-BP). Di mana, prediktor hybrid bekerja dengan memberikan koefisien pada masing-masing keluaran prediktor. Koefisien-koefisien tersebut ditentukan berdasarkan proses optimasi dengan algoritma Differential Evolutin (DE). Hasil prediksi tersebut ditampilkan kepada pengguna melalui User Interface berbasis Android, sehingga informasi cuaca dapat diakses menggunakan mobile smartphone di manapun dan kapanpun oleh siapapun secara realtime. Penelitian ini menemukan bahwa prediktor hybrid memiliki keunggulan performa baik dalam parameter RMSE maupun MAPE pada semua variabel dibandingkan prediktor tunggal masing-masing (JST dan IT2FIS) saat proses pelatihan. Namun, dalam tahap pengujian performa prediktor hybrid tidak selalu lebih baik dari keduanya. Berdasarkan standar prediktor berbasis MAPE, prediktor suhu dan kelembaban termasuk ke dalam prediktor highly accurate, kecepatan angin termasuk reasonable forecast, dan prediktor arah angin dan curah hujan termasuk ke dalam inacurate forecast. Sementara, percobaan prediksi beberapa hari ke depan menghasilkan pola prediksi yang semakin konvergen seiring bertambahnya hari ke depan yang diprediksi, yang mana pola ini berlaku pada semua variabel.

        "excerpt":"The object the research is to forecast maritime weather variables such wind speed and direction, temperature and wave height for an hour ahead by using artificial intelligence approach. Artificial intelligence is comprised of hybrid neural networks modified by genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization which are functioned as a model predictor. The hybrid predictor works on every single predictor by weighing both artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) and artificial neural network-particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO) which weight is calculated by differential evolution algorithm optimization. When the unsurpassed model is obtained, it will be validated across real-time data that is delivered from type II buoyweather station measurement at the Madura Strait, Java Sea. The prediction results of learning and validation process indicate that the ANN-Hybrid predictor perform more accurate than the ANN-GA and ANN PSO on training and validation. However, the gap of RMSE on real-time test is relatively high compared to validation or training. It can be influenced by the different frequent of weather fluctuation between them. Concurring to real-time test stage, the foremost appropriate variable that predicted by this ANN-Hybrid is temperature.   [Paper]  ","categories": [],
